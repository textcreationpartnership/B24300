            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>Christian Reader,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>ALthough the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Sermons</hi> need no <hi>Epistle</hi> to commend them to any intelligent <hi>Reader;</hi> yet Custom having made it necessary to say something, for the Satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the World, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the <hi>Posthumous Works</hi> of deceased Persons, I shall therefore speak a few Words briefly.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:206211:4"/>
            <p>The Reverend <hi>Prelate,</hi> the Author of them, was a Person of great natural Parts, and Excellent Learning, as well as of great Piety and Charity: One that ador<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the <hi>Church of England,</hi> whereof he was an Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent <hi>Pillar,</hi> ruling well in the Church of God, &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore deserved <hi>double Honour,</hi> as the <hi>Apostle</hi> speaks: And doubtless, his Reward is now great in Heaven, with his Lord and Master, whose Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice here on Earth was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted by him as his high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Honour, and that which he professed himself most ambitious of.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:206211:4"/>
            <p>He was a Person of great Modesty and Humility; having very mean and low Thoughts of himself, and his own Abilities; which was the Reason why the World had so little Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of him from the <hi>Press,</hi> having published nothing<note n="*" place="margin">See his <hi>Vanity of the World,</hi> and <hi>A Funeral Sermon,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Octavo.</hi>
               </note> but what he was constrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to, either by the rest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less Importunity of <hi>Friends,</hi> or the Commands of those that some Time were his <hi>Superiors.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the Intendment of this <hi>Epistle</hi> being not to give the World an Account of the Life of this Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
<pb facs="tcp:206211:5"/>Person, whose Praise is deservedly in the <hi>Church of God;</hi> I forbear to add any thing farther concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning him, hoping it will shortly be done by a more worthy Pen.</p>
            <p>And as for the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Sermons,</hi> the excellent Style in which they are written, and the exact Accuracy with which they are penn'd, may give abundant Satisfaction unto All, in the Reading of them, that they are His <hi>Lordship</hi>'s own, and were fairly written with his own Hand, and copied out
<pb facs="tcp:206211:5"/>from thence, since his <hi>Death,</hi> by one of his <hi>nea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest Relations,</hi> and so trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted unto the Press.</p>
            <p>The Subject Matter of them being agreeable to the Divine Inspirations of the <hi>Holy Scriptures,</hi> will speak better for themselves, than the Words of any other can. And that they may be very useful and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable unto those that heard them, and unto all that shall read them, is the hearty and sincere Prayer of the <hi>Publisher. Farewell.</hi>

            <p>WE are not generally to expect any connexion, either of Sense or Sentences in this Book of the <hi>Proverbs.</hi> O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther parts of Scripture are like a rich <hi>Mine,</hi> where the precious <hi>Ore</hi> runs along in one continued <hi>Vein:</hi> But this is like a Heap of
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:206211:8"/>
               <hi>Pearls;</hi> which, though they are loose and unstrung, are not therefore the less excellent or va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Text</hi> I have now read, is one of them, an entire Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position in it self, without rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to, or dependance upon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Context.</p>
            <p>In it,<note place="margin">The Division of the Words.</note> we have these things considerable.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> The <hi>Character</hi> or <hi>Peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrasis</hi> of wicked and ungodly Men; and they are said to be such as <hi>make a Mock at Sin.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/> Here is the Censure past upon them by the All-wise God, and the wisest of Men; they are <hi>Fools</hi> for so doing; <hi>Fools make a Mock at Sin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Words are plain and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious; only the Phrase of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king a <hi>Mock,</hi> may seem subject to some ambiguity, and various
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:206211:8"/>acceptations; and indeed the <hi>Scripture</hi> useth it in divers Senses. Sometimes it signifies an abusing of others, by violent and lewd Actions: So we read that <hi>the Hebrew Servant,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gen. 39.17.</note> says <hi>Potiphar</hi>'s Wife, <hi>came in unto me to mock me.</hi> Sometimes it signifies an expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of Men to Shame and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shonour: So the wise Man tells us, <hi>Wine is a mocker.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Prov. 20.<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>.</note> Sometimes it signifies an imposing upon the Credulity of others, things that seem incredible and impossible: So we read in <hi>Genesis,</hi> when <hi>Lot</hi> had declared to his Sons-in-Law the Destruction of <hi>Sodom,</hi> it is said,<note place="margin">Gen. 19 14.</note>
               <hi>He seemed unto them as one that mocked.</hi> Sometimes it is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken for a failing in our Promises, and thereby defeating, and fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strating the Expectations of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers: And thus <hi>Herod</hi> is said to be <hi>mocked by the wise Men,</hi>

            <p>I know it will be here pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, that surely it can be no
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:206211:12"/>such great Crime to explode and hiss Sin off the <hi>Stage;</hi> nay, it were a proper Means to keep Men from being generally so wicked, could we but make Wickedness more ridiculous in them.</p>
            <p>But, alas! <hi>Vice</hi> is now-a-days grown too impudent to be laughed out of Countenance; and those Methods of a scurri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Mockery, which some plead for, as rendring Vice ridiculous, have, I doubt, only made it the more taking and spreading, and encouraged others to be the more openly sinfull, by teaching them to be the more wittily vile and wicked. Few will be deterred from sinning, when they think they shall but gratifie others, by making Sport for them; and stir up, not their Indignation and Abhorrence, but their Mirth and
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:206211:13"/>Laughter. 'Tis true, we read that <hi>Elijah</hi> mock'd the Idolatrous Worshippers of <hi>Baal,</hi> and his Scoffs and Taunts at them were very biting and <hi>sarcastical,</hi> and cut them much deeper than they are said to cut themselves: But this he did in a serious and zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous reproving of their Sins, not in a jocular and sportive Merri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. There are two things in Sin, Impiety and Folly; we may lawfully enough scorn the one, while we are sure to hate and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test the other: And a due Mixture of both these together, Scorn and Detestation, are very fit to enkindle our Zeal for God, and may oftentimes be a requisite Temper for him who is to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove confident and audacious Sinners. But to laugh and sport at others Wickedness, and to make the Guilt and Shame of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:206211:13"/>our Mirth and Recreation, is both unchristian, and inhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane; and we may as well laugh at their Damnation, as at that which will lead them to it. Thus to make a Mock at Sin, is to make our very Mocks to be our Sins; and argues us, not only profane, but foolish; for this is to laugh and rejoyce at our own Stain and Dishonour, and to abuse our own Nature, that Nature which is common to us, as well as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; that Nature which, were it not debased with Sin, renders us but a little lower than the <hi>Angels.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What a fair and glorious Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture was Man, before Sin deba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed and sullied him! A Friend to his God, Lord of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, made a little lower than the <hi>Angels,</hi> being a-kin to them, though of a younger House, and
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:206211:14"/>meaner Extract, adorn'd with all both natural and divine Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, till Sin despoil'd him of his Excellency, and made him who was almost <hi>equal to the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels,</hi> worse than the very <hi>Brutes</hi> that perish, sottish and misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. And canst thou laugh and sport thy self at that which hath ruin'd and undone thee, as well as others? Thy Nature is ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish'd and corrupted as much as theirs. When we look abroad in the World, and observe the abominable Wickednesses that are every where committed, the Murthers, Uncleannesses, Blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemies, Drunkenness, and all those Prodigies of Impiety that every where swarm amongst Men; how <hi>by Lying, Stealing, Swearing, and Committing Adultery, they break out,</hi>

               <hi>until Blood toucheth Blood.</hi> What else see we now
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:206211:14"/>in all this, but the woful Effects of our own corrupt Nature: Here we see our selves unbowel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and discover what we our selves are, at the price of other Men's Sins; <hi>For as in Water,</hi>

               <hi>Face answereth unto Face, so doth the Heart of Man to Man.</hi> We have therefore more reason to lament the Sins and Miscarriages of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, than to make a Sport and Mock at their Wickedness, since we our selves are the very same, and prone enough, without the Restraining Grace of God, either to imitate, or exceed them.</p>

               <note place="margin">Sinners not being exempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily punished, causes them to make light of Sin.</note> Because they see so few In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances of God's dread Wrath and Vengeance executed on Sinners in this Life; and those rare Ones that are extant and visible, they impute rather to Chance, than to the Retribution of Divine Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice: And therefore, upon their own Impunity, and the Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of others, they conclude, That certainly Sin is no such hei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous thing as some sowre, tetri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal People would fain persuade the World to believe: And so they cry <hi>Peace, Peace, to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Deut. 29.19.</note>
               <hi>though they go on in the Fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardness of their Hearts, adding Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity to Sin.</hi> Because God so long
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:206211:20"/>winks at them, they conclude him blind, or at least, that he doth not much disallow those Sins which he doth not presently punish. Indeed, it would be somewhat difficult to <hi>answer</hi> this <hi>Argument,</hi> were this present Life the appointed Time of Recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence. No, but God reserveth his Wrath and Vengeance to a more publick, and more dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Execution of it, than any can be in this Life. Though now thou feelest no Effects of God's Wrath, yet, believe it, the Storm is but all this while gathering: But when thou launchest forth into the boundless Ocean of Eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, then, and perhaps never be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore then, will it break upon thee in a Tempest of Fury, and drown thy Soul in Perdition and Destruction.</p>

               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:206211:21"/>II. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
               <note place="margin">Sinners make light of Sin, because it is no real Injury to God.</note> Another thing that makes wicked Men think so slight of Sin, is that it cannot affect God with any real Injury; for as he is not benefited by our Services, so he is not wronged by our Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities. 'Tis true, could our Sins reach God, could they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throne him, or rend off any of his glorious Attributes from his immutable Essence, there might then be great Reason why God should so severely revenge them, and we for ever detest and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hor them: But since his Glory is free from any Stain, and his Being from any Wrong and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice, our Sins are nothing to him, nor is there any Reason we should judge them heinous and provoking.</p>
            <p>'Tis true, <hi>O Sinner,</hi> thy Sins can never invade God's Essence; that is infinitely above the At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:206211:21"/>of Men or Devils, but yet every wicked Wretch would, if he could, dethrone God: Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners would not have him be so holy, nor so just as he is; not so holy in hating of their Sins, nor so just in punishing of them; that is, they would not have him to be God; for it is neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary that God should be as he is. Sinners do really contradict God's Purity, rebel against his Sovereignty, violate his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, defie his Justice, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke his Mercy, despise his Threatnings, and hinder the Manifestations of his Glory to the World: And is all this no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing? Every Sinner hath so much Poyson and Venom in him, that he would even spit it in the Face of God himself, if he could reach him: But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause God is in himself secure
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:206211:22"/>from their impotent Assaults, Sin shews its Spight against him in what it can; defaceth his Image where-ever it comes, abolisheth all Structures and Lineaments of God in the Soul, and would ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish his Name, his Fear, his Worship from off the Face of the whole Earth: And therefore thou who art guilty of this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion against the great Majesty of Heaven, canst thou yet think thy Sins to be slight and inconsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable, and not worth either the Cognizance, or the Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance of the Almighty? Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it, the <hi>Day</hi> is coming, and will not tarry, when that Guilt which thou now carriest so peaceably in thy Bosom, and which, like a frozen and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numb'd <hi>Serpent,</hi> stirrs not, nor stings not, shall, when heated with the Flames of Hell, fly in
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:206211:22"/>thy Face, and appear in all its native and genuine Deformities and Horrour, and overwhelm thy Soul with Everlasting An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish and Torment; and then, but too late, then wilt thou ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim against thy self, as being worse than a <hi>Fool,</hi> or Mad-man, for thinking so slightly of, and making a <hi>Mock</hi> at that which hath eternally ruin'd and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed thee.</p>

Or, if Vengeance should spare thee for a while, O Sinner, yet thou knowest not how soon it will strike thee: It is great Folly to expect the War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of a sick Bed; <hi>Death</hi> often surprizes by sudden Casualties, or by some Diseases as sudden as Casualties; and there are many Ways of <hi>Dying,</hi> besides <hi>Consum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptions, Agues,</hi> and <hi>Dropsies,</hi> the lingring Fore-runners of an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching Dissolution.

               <pb n="33" facs="tcp:206211:25"/>Distempers as may make thee not only unfit, but such as may render thee uncapable of doing thy last kind Office for it.

The older thou growest, still the more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperate is thy Case; for thy Sins will be the more rooted and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bituated in thee, and thy Heart the more hardned to resist the Grace of God: So that, upon all Accounts, thy Repentance is

And then judge, thou thy self, whether it be not extream Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and Folly, to make so light, or no Account of Sinning, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause thou makest account of Repenting. But</p>
            <p n="2">2. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Suppose it were most in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly certain that thou shalt <hi>repent,</hi>

<pb n="35" facs="tcp:206211:26"/>
               <hi>Repentance</hi> is the breaking of the Heart, a rending of the very Soul in pieces: The usual Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratives to it are ghastly Fears and Terrours, sharp and dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Convictions, that will even search thy very Bowels, break thy Bones, and burn up thy very Marrow within thee. More especially doth God deal thus terribly with veterane, old, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed Sinners, making <hi>Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance</hi> more bitter to them, than to others, that they may see and confess themselves <hi>Fools,</hi> in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulging themselves in their Sins, in hopes of repenting for them. Say then, when the <hi>Devil</hi> and thine own Lusts tempt thee to any Sin; say, If I commit this Sin, either I shall repent of it, or I shall not; if I never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent of it, as it is a hazard whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I shall or no, what is there

And if we would but always keep this fixed in our Minds, it were impossible that ever we should make slight of Sin.

            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Here is the Proof of this Proposition, in these Words, that <hi>They have a Right to the Tree of Life, and shall enter through the Gates into the City.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is the Connection of both these together, that I intend chiefly to speak unto. Only give me leave, as a Preliminary to the ensuing Discourse, to shew you what is contained in the first and great Word in my <hi>Text;</hi> and that is, the Word <hi>Blessed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There is therefore, a Twofold <hi>Beatitude,</hi> or <hi>Blessedness:</hi> The One is <hi>perfect</hi> and <hi>consummate;</hi> the Other <hi>initial</hi> and <hi>incompleat.</hi> The former is the Complection of all Good perfective of our Natures, and our entire and satisfying En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of it. This Blessedness now is only attainable in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; for God alone is the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre of all Good, and all the Good
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:206211:30"/>that is desirable in this World, are but so many Lines drawn from the Centre, to the utmost Circumference of the Creation. There is nothing that can supply the Wants, perform the Hopes, fulfil the Desires, without Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finement circumscribe, without cloying satisfie the most enlar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged Capacities of a Rational Soul, but only that God who is infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely, universally, and indefe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctively good; and therefore he alone is our objective Happiness: and our formal Happiness is our Relation to, and Union with this All-comprehensive and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comprehensible Good. Our As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>similation to him, and Partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation from him, of all those Perfections which our Natures are capable of enjoying, but our Understandings not now capable of knowing. But this <hi>consummate
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:206211:31"/>Blessedness,</hi> is reserved for our unknown Reward hereafter, and is not that which my <hi>Text</hi> here speaks of.</p>
            <p>There is therefore an <hi>imperfect</hi> and <hi>initial Blessedness,</hi> which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists in a Preparation for, and a Tendency unto the other: As those are <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 span">

                  <hi>Blessed in Hope.</hi> Titus 2.13.</note> They are blessed <hi>in Spe,</hi> in Hope; whence it is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by the Apostle, <hi>That blessed Hope.</hi> A blessed Hope it is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause that which we hope for is <hi>Eternal Blessedness.</hi> The Hope of worldly Things is commonly more tormenting, than the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of them can be satisfy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. It is an Hope that vitiates and deflowers its Object, and so mightily Over-rates them in the Fancy, that when they come to pass, our Hope is rather frustra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:206211:33"/>than accomplished: And were it not for that Impatience, which is the constant Attendant of this Hope, it would be a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blem hard to be resolved, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Expectation or Fruition were the more eligible Estate. Vain therefore and wretched must needs be the Hopes of those things, which cannot answer what is expected from them; like a Golden Dream to a Beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar, or the Dream of a furnish'd Table to one that is hunger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>starv'd. But now the Hopes of Heaven can never impoverish the Glories of it, for they are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite and inexhaustible; and God hath laid up for his, that which the Heart of Man cannot conceive.</p>
            <p>A Christian's Hope hath Two Prerogatives above any worldly Hope.<note place="margin">Two Properties of a Christian's Hope</note>
            </p>
            <pb n="49" facs="tcp:206211:33"/>
            <p>One is, That it may attain to a full and final Assurance, as the <hi>Apostle</hi> speaks to the <hi>Hebrews;</hi> where he calls it,<note place="margin">Heb. 6.11.</note>
               <hi>The full Assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of Hope unto the End.</hi> An Hope it is, because the Object of it is a future Good desired and expected. But yet it is an Hope that is joined with a full Assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of the Event; an Hope that may flower up into such a Certainty, as to have no Mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Fear or Doubting in its Composition; but may be as sure of the Heavenly Inheritance, as if our Reversion were already in actual Possession: Whereas Worldly Hope can never be se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure, but some Providence or other may interpose, to disap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point it.</p>
            <p>The other <hi>Prerogative</hi> of a Christian's Hope, is, that though it be thus fully assured, yet the
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:206211:34"/>Accomplishment of it shall al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways have the sweet Relish of Surprize and Wonder; for the Happiness will be far greater than the Hope, and the Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance larger than the Expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; whereas Earthly Hopes, if they grow to any degree of Confidence of Success, upon Fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration they turn into Impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience and Rage: Or if perhaps they do succeed, the Sweetness of the Accomplishment was long before suck'd out and devoured by our greedy Expectation; the <hi>Game</hi> is torn and eaten, before the <hi>Hunts-man</hi> can come in. And upon both these Accounts, the pious and obedient Christian is blessed in Hope: It is a blessed Hope that shall certainly be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complished; and a blessed Hope, the accomplishing of which shall infinitely exceed our Expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:206211:34"/>and fill us, not with Shame, but Eternal Admiration and Wonder.</p>

               <hi>On either Side of the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver was there the Tree of Life, which bare twelve manner of Fruits, and yielded her Fruit every Month; and the Leaves of the Tree were for the healing of the Nations.</hi> But this, very probably, may be only an Enigmatical Representation of the Doctrine of the Gospel; let us then consult the other place, where Mention is made of this <hi>Tree of Life,</hi> and that is in <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.7. <hi>To him that overcometh will I give to eat of the Tree of Life, that is in the midst of the Paradise of God.</hi> Now this carries a plain Allusion to that

               <hi>God planted the Tree of Life in the midst of the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den.</hi> Now this <hi>Tree of Life</hi> was so called, not that it had any natural Vertue to perpetuate Man's Life to Immortality, but only from its <hi>typical</hi> and <hi>sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental</hi> Use; God having appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Eating thereof as a Sign and Pledge of our Immortality, had we continued in our Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency and Obedience.

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>I answer,</hi> Though in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going <hi>Chapter</hi> this <hi>City</hi> is descri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed to have <hi>twelve Gates, and in them the Names of the Twelve Tribes of</hi> Israel, to signifie to us, that through the Grace of the Gospel, there is a Passage and an Inlet into Heaven for all those that are true <hi>Israelites;</hi> yet, in true propriety of Speech, there is but one Way, and but one Gate to Heaven: Yea, and our Saviour tells us, that Way is narrow, and that Gate is strait; for so we find his Words;<note place="margin">Matth. 7.14.</note>
               <hi>Strait is the Gate, and narrow is the Way, that leadeth unto Life, and few there be that find it.</hi> The Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God are this Gate to the Heavenly City, and the two
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:206211:37"/>Tables of the Law are the two Leaves of this Gate, through which every one must pass, that hopes to be admitted into the <hi>New Jerusalem.</hi> And although <hi>David</hi> seems to make this Gate very large, when he tells us, <hi>Thy Commandments are exceeding broad;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psal. 119.96.</note> yet that is only to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood concerning the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of its Injunctions, not of the Liberty of its Indulgence. It is exceeding broad in the Extent of its preceptive Power, for it prescribes Rules to all our Thoughts, Words, and Actions, and to every Circumstance of each; but it is exceeding narrow and strait in the Scope and Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance that it gives us; that as soon may <hi>a Camel go through the Eye of a Needle,</hi> as we pass through this Gate with the Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then of one unmortified Lust, or one unrepented Sin.</p>

            <p n="1">I. What that <hi>Obedience</hi> is, which gives us a <hi>Right</hi> to Heaven.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I answer:</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> It is not a Legal <hi>Obedience,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Not Legal Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience.</note> or a perfect personal Righteousness, that now gives us this <hi>Right</hi> to Heaven; this is
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:206211:38"/>very plain, because to constitute this, it is necessary that there be both Original Purity in our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, which since the Fall is miserably vitiated and corrupted; and also a Sinless Perfection in our Lives, in the constant Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation of every <hi>Iota</hi> of the Law, both as to its Extention, and Intention; that we obey it in every part and tittle of it, and that our Obedience unto every part be raised to the highest de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of Love, Zeal, and Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. This <hi>Title</hi> was once good, but it is now lost, by the Fall, in the common Ruine and Rub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bish of Mankind; and he who hath not another <hi>Title,</hi> upon bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and easier Terms, will find <hi>Cherubims,</hi> and the Flaming Sword of Divine Justice, set to guard the <hi>Tree of Life</hi> from his Approaches; as once they did from guilty <hi>Adam.</hi>
            </p>

               <pb n="60" facs="tcp:206211:39"/>II. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> There is therefore another <hi>Obedience</hi> which gives a <hi>Right</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the <hi>Tree of Life;</hi>
               <note place="margin">It is Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</note> and that is an Evangelical Obedience; which, according to the Grace, Condescension, and Equity of the Gospel, shall be accepted unto, and rewarded with Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting Happiness. Now this Evangelical Obedience consists not indeed in Innocency and Perfection, but in sincere Desires, and proportionable Endeavours after it; when we strive to the utmost to live holily, and to walk more strictly with God, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Rules that he hath prescribed us in his holy Word: And it consists of Two Parts; <hi>Mortification</hi> of our corrupt and sinful Affections, whereby we die daily unto Sin: And the <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Penovation,</hi> and Quickning of our Graces, whereby we in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:206211:39"/>daily in spiritual Strength, and make farther Progresses in Holiness and true Piety. And as it consists of these Two Parts, so hath it also these two Adjuncts.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The one is, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> True Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance for our past Sins, reflecting upon them with Shame and Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred, confessing and bewailing them with Sorrow and Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and endeavouring, with all Earnestness and Sincerity, to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stain from the Commission of the like for the future.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The other is, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> A True and Lively Faith, whereby we rely on the Blood and Satisfaction of Jesus Christ, for the Remission of our Sins; and upon his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Righteousness, and preva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Intercession for the Accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation and Reward of our im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect Obedience.</p>
            <pb n="62" facs="tcp:206211:40"/>
            <p>Whosoever doth thus sincerely do the Commandments of God, universally and constantly, with his whole Strength and Mind, as though he expected to be saved by the Merits of his own Works; and yet, after all, doth so entirely rely on the Merits of Jesus Christ for Salvation, as though he had never done any thing: He it is, and he alone, who hath this <hi>Right unto the Tree of Eife, and shall enter through the Gates into the Heavenly City.</hi> For he doth his Commandments out of a sincere Love; and God, who is Love, will own his Sincerity.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/> I come now to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider what that <hi>Right</hi> is,<note place="margin">What Right Obedience gives to Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Life.</note> which this Evangelical Obedience, or doing the Commands of the I aw, according to the Favour and Mercy of the Gospel, doth confer upon us, by virtue of

            <p n="1">I. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> It cannot be a <hi>Right of Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chace, or Merit.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Not a Right of Purchace.</note> It is a foolish Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption, and intollerable Arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance, to think we can deserve any thing at the hands of God, unless it be his Wrath by our Sins. For,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> In all proper Merit there must be an Equivalence,<note place="margin">In Merit there must be an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quivalence.</note> or at least a proportion of Worth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Work, and the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward: Which to imagine be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween our Obedience, and the Heavenly Glory, is to exalt the one infinitely too high, and to abase the other infinitely too low.

<pb n="64" facs="tcp:206211:41"/>expect to buy <hi>Stars</hi> with <hi>Counters,</hi> or to purchaseaKingdom with Two Mites, than think to purchase the Heavenly Kingdom by paying down his Duties, and good Works, which are no way profitable unto God,<note place="margin">Job 22.3.</note>

               </label> No, it doth no preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice unto Faith; for we still affirm, that our original and fundamental Right to Heaven is grounded, not upon our Obedience, but Christ's; not upon our Works, but upon his; his Merits and Purchase, which, through Faith, are imparted and imputed to us. Yet give me leave to say, that I think the Notion of Justifying and Saving Faith is very much, if not generally mistaken by us: And as the Soul is the most noble, and most vital Principle of Man, and yet is most unknown to him what it is, and how it ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates;
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:206211:47"/>so Faith, which is the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Principle of Christians, and by which the Just are said to live, is yet most unknown, both as to its Nature and Operations, unto the Generality of them: Some place it in Assurance, some in Affiance and Recumbence; some in one Act of Faith, and some in another; which are either the Effects of Faith as true, or the Degrees of it as strong, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than the proper and adequate Nature and Essence of it; and then they mightily puzzle themselves how to accord and reconcile Faith and Obedience in carrying on the great Work of our Salvation, which yet were never at a variance about it, but only in their mistaken <hi>Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thesis:</hi> For what is Faith, but an As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent to a Testimony? The very force and import of the Word can carry no other Sense: And he that saith he believes, must needs mean he believes some Record or Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony;
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:206211:48"/>or else he speaks that which neither himself, nor any other can understand. Consequently there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a Divine Faith must be an As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent to a Divine Testimony; that is, to the Word of God contained in the Holy Scriptures. But now if this Faith rest only in a bare and naked Assent to the Truth of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Revelation, it is but Historical and Dogmatical; which, though it be a Divine Faith in respect of the Objects believed, yet is it but Humane and Natural in respect of its Principle and Motives. But when this Assent to the Truths of the Scripture is joined with propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable Affections to those Truths, and doth excite us to Actions con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable to the Discoveries of the Divine Will, there this Faith is Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifying and Saving. And certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly this is not so very distant from Obedience, as to be thought hardly
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:206211:48"/>reconcileable with it. As for In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, A Man may give a bare As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent to this great Gospel-Truth, that <hi>Jesus Christ came into the World to save Sinners,</hi> and yet this Faith may not save him, because it may be unope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative, and pass no farther than the Act of the Understanding: This is a dead Faith, which can never bring any Man to Heaven; yea, such a Faith as the very <hi>Devils,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Jam. 2.19.</note> and <hi>Damned Spirits</hi> in Hell have, <hi>who believe and tremble.</hi> Another Man believes the same Truth, and assents to the same Proposition; but this his Assent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluenceth his Affections, and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verns his Actions, in Conformity to the Nature and Consequences of such a Belief: And because he is assured that Jesus Christ came into the World to be the Saviour of it, therefore he loves him, trusts in him, relies upon him, hopes in his Promises, and obeys his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands.
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:206211:49"/>And this,<note place="margin">What Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Faith is.</note> indeed, is a true Saving, Justifying Faith; for Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Faith is a firm Assent unto the Truths of God revealed in the holy Scriptures, working in us propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable Affections and Actions. He who so believes <hi>the Glory of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,</hi> as to have his Endeavours thereby quickned to use his utmost Diligence for the obtaining of it: He who so believes <hi>the Torments of Hell,</hi> as thereby to be terrified from doing any thing that might expose him to so great and fearful a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation: He who so believes <hi>the Attributes of God,</hi> as thereby to be excited to fear him for his Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, to love him for his Goodness, to imitate him in his Bounty, Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and Holiness: He who so be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves <hi>the All-sufficiency, Merits, and Mediatory Office of Jesus Christ,</hi> as thereby to be engaged with all his Soul to love him, to trust in him,
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:206211:49"/>to rely upon him alone for Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and to yield to him all sincere Obedience, as the Law requires; such an one's Faith is Saving and Justifying. So that you see there is no such Discord between Faith and Works, as some would imagine; for that Faith that saves us, <hi>must work by Love;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gal. 5.6.</note> and those Works which capacitate us for Salvation, must be <hi>the Obedience of Faith,</hi>

               <hi>What will this Babler say? because he preached to them Jesus, and the Resurrection.</hi> No doubt they wanted not very specious Arguments to urge against the <hi>Resurrection</hi> of the Body: As first, The Impossibility of a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collection of the dispersed Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of Men, resolved into their Elements, and scatter'd by the Four Winds of Heaven; though it might be very well retorted on the <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cureans,</hi> who disputed with Saint

               <hi>Paul,</hi> against the <hi>Resurrection,</hi> that it was not so unlikely a thing, that there might be a Re-union of the scatter'd Parts of the same Man, as the fortuitous Concourse of <hi>Atoms</hi> at the first Making of the World; yet this <hi>Objection</hi> overbore and prevail'd with <hi>Heathens,</hi> that when they burnt the Bodies of <hi>Christians,</hi> they cast their Ashes into the Rivers, to confute their Hopes of ever being raised again; from whence they should be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried away into an unknown <hi>Ocean,</hi> and there be made the Sport of Winds and Waves.

            <p>And thus it appears, these <hi>Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> against the <hi>Resurrection</hi> of the Body, amount not to prove the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possibility of the Effect; but only

               <hi>why it should be thought a strange and incredible thing, that God should raise the Dead;</hi> and in the <hi>Text,</hi> that he asserts the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection</hi> of <hi>Christ.</hi> And to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent any fallacious Cavils against it, he shews,</p>

            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Reasons why Christ could not be held un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Power of Death.</note> It was impossible Christ should be held under the Power of Death, because of that great and ineffable Mystery of the Hyposta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Union of the Divine and Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Nature in the Person of Christ. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/>
               <note place="margin">Because of the Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>statical Union.</note> There are three <hi>Unions,</hi> the Belief of which are the Foundation of the greatest part of the <hi>Christian Religion,</hi> which are wholly beyond the reach of Reason: The <hi>Mystical Union</hi> of a Believer unto Christ: The <hi>Union,</hi> or rather <hi>Unity</hi> of the three Glorious Persons, <hi>the Father, the Son,</hi> and <hi>the
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:206211:58"/>Holy Ghost,</hi> in one Nature; and this <hi>Hypostatical Union</hi> of two Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures in one Person, in the Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator. It is a Mystery <hi>Angels</hi> pry into, and adore, with Wonder and Asto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment, how the Eternal, only begotten Son of God should assume Flesh to himself, in so close and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate a Conjunction, that though he be Eternal, yet he should be born; though he be Immortal, yet he should truly die; and though he were truly dead, yet he should raise himself to Life again. These are things that seem very inconsistent one with another, yet they truly come to pass through this miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Union, which transcends the Reach of <hi>Reason,</hi> as far as these things do that of Nature. That the same Person that is Eternal, should be young; yea, be born in the Fulness of Time. That the same Person that hath Immortality
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:206211:59"/>and Life dwelling in himself, should also die a shameful and accursed Death. That the same Person that was truly and really dead, yet had a power to quicken and recover himself, <hi>Joh.</hi> 10.18. And this was it which <hi>declared him to be the Son of God with Power,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 1.4.</note> as the <hi>Apostle</hi> speaks, <hi>even by his Resurrection from the Dead.</hi> And indeed, if he had not risen from the Dead; the Deity would have suffered in the Opinion of the World; nor would they have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved him to be the Son of God, who would suffer himself to lie un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Dominion of <hi>Death,</hi> longer than the End of his <hi>Death</hi> required it: And this I shall demonstrate to you by two Arguments; only pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mising this, which is a common and true Maxim among Divines; <hi>That when the Natural Union between Christ's Body and Soul was dissolved, yet both Soul and Body did retain the
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:206211:59"/>Hypostatical Union to the Divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. The Divine Nature was united to the Body of Christ, when the Soul was separated from it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">I. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> If Christ could not have rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed himself, it must have been ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from a Want of Power, or from a Want of Will to do it. He could not want Power to raise himself, because he was God, equal in Power, and in all other Divine At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes, with the Father. As the <hi>Resurrection of the Dead</hi> is not impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible to the infinite Power of God, so neither can it be that that God who had a Will to assume our Flesh, should want a Will to raise it up: That that God who so lov'd the Humane Nature, as to associate it into Oneness of Person with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, should yet suffer it to continue under the power of <hi>Death,</hi> which is, of all things, most contrary to his natural Inclinations. We see
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:206211:60"/>Christ, in his Agony, prayed most fervently that the bitter Cup might pass from him, insomuch that he strained clotted Blood through him; and certainly, one Ingredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent into that Cup was the Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Soul and Body by <hi>Death;</hi> which is that which even innocent Nature it self abhorred, as destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive to him; yet having taken our Nature upon him for this very End, that <hi>by Death he might destroy him that had the power of Death,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Heb. 2.14.</note>
               <hi>that is, the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil,</hi> he voluntarily submitted him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to undergo it; and this End be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fully accomplish'd by his <hi>Death,</hi> and the Truth of his <hi>Death</hi> likewise attested by his lying three Days in the Earth, it was altogether impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible that that Person who had an Abhorrence of Death, and a Power to raise himself, should continue longer under the Arrest and Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of it. And this is the <hi>first</hi> De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:206211:60"/>of the Necessity of the Resurrection of Christ, upon the Account of both Natures in one Person: As Man, so he abhorred the Separation of Soul and Body; as God, so he was able to re-unite them: So that having, as Man, a Desire to live, and as God, a Power to live, it was impossible for him to be holden of <hi>Death.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">II. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Because of the Union of the Divine and Humane Nature in the Person of Christ, it was impossible that his Flesh should see Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; which yet it must certainly have done, had he not been raised in a short space after his Death. for since Christ's Body was not a phantastical Body, as some of old held, but made of true Flesh, and of the same Temper and Constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with ours, it must, without a <hi>Miracle,</hi> have undergone such Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges after <hi>Death</hi> as ours shall do;
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:206211:61"/>and to imagine the contrary, is but to feign one <hi>Miracle,</hi> to avoid the necessity of another, even of the <hi>Resurrection.</hi> But now, it was ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly impossible that that Body that was united to both Natures, by so close and unconceivable a Bond, should ever see Corruption; that is, a Putrefaction in the Grave: This the <hi>Scripture</hi> clearly asserts to us;<note place="margin">Act. 2.28.</note>
               <hi>Thou wilt not leave my Soul in Hell, neither wilt thou suffer thine Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly One to see Corruption.</hi> And also, because all Bodies that are corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted turn into some other Thing, and some other Nature, according to that undoubted Maxim of the <hi>Philosophers, Corruptio unius est Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratio alterius:</hi> And so this horrid and blasphemous Consequence would follow, that the Divine Nature of the Son of God might have been joyned to some other. So that it was necessary that Christ should be
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:206211:61"/>raised again, before any Corruption or Putrefaction, by ordinary Course of Nature, seized upon him.</p>
            <p>Thus I have proved by these <hi>two Arguments,</hi> that because of the <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postatical Union</hi> of the Divine and Humane Nature of Christ in one Person, it was altogether impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble he could be holden of <hi>Death.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Another <hi>Argument</hi> is this, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/> It was impossible Christ should be holden of <hi>Death,</hi> because of God's Veracity, and the Truth of those Predictions which were before made concerning Christ, in those many <hi>Types</hi> and <hi>Prophecies</hi> of the <hi>Old Testament;</hi> all which God's Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness stood engaged to fulfil. I shall only mention that famous <hi>Prediction</hi> which St. <hi>Peter</hi> here sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joins, as a Proof of the Subject I am now treating upon: <hi>It was not possible,</hi> says he,<note place="margin">Act. 2.2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>.</note> the <hi>Apostle</hi> proves, <hi>Ver.</hi> 29, 30. of this <hi>Chapter;</hi> where he proves that <hi>David</hi> was dead and bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried, and underwent the common Lot that all other dead Bodies did, putrefying and mouldering away in the Earth; and therefore he was not that <hi>Holy One</hi> that should never see Corruption, because that <hi>Prophecy</hi> must belong to such an one who must so taste of <hi>Death;</hi> and this is clearly implied in the former Expression, <hi>Thou wilt not leave my Soul in Hell,</hi> that is, in the State o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> the Dead, for so is Hell to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood there, as I shall shew
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:206211:62"/>more at large: Neither could it belong to any of those who, before Christ, were raised miraculously from the Dead, and brought back out of the State of <hi>Death;</hi> yet was it not in such a manner, that they were not to return again to it: So that if they did not in the first, yet in their second Dying they saw Corruption. This then could be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to none of them, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore must of necessity belong to Christ. And since the <hi>Apostle</hi> lays so much stress on this Argument, give me leave a little to consider the meaning of it, and how it is applicable to him. And here I shall not trouble you with the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious <hi>Opinions</hi> of those that have at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted to interpret these Words, <hi>Thou wilt not leave my Soul in Hell;</hi> that by this <hi>Hell,</hi> into which Christ descended, is meant the place of the Damned, where he preached the
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:206211:63"/>
               <hi>Gospel</hi> to them, freeing those that would believe from their Pains. Others think that this Hell, into which Christ descended, was one great Partition of it, called <hi>Limbus Patrum,</hi> the Repository of the Souls of those <hi>Fathers</hi> who died in Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to God, and in Faith to the <hi>Messias,</hi> before Christ came in the Flesh: And the Reason of his Descent thither was, that he might release those Souls from Chains, and carry them with him to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; so that ever since, that <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion</hi> in <hi>Hell</hi> hath been left void, without any Inhabitants. But this <hi>Opinion</hi> is not capable of any suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Proof; I shall therefore give you that Interpretation and Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which carries with it the strongest Current, both of <hi>Scripture</hi> and <hi>Reason.</hi> The Word <hi>Hades,</hi> that we <hi>translate Hell,</hi> is very of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, by the <hi>Septuagint,</hi> in the <hi>Old
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:206211:63"/>Testament,</hi> used to signifie the <hi>Grave,</hi> or the State of the Dead. So in <hi>Gen.</hi> 44. <hi>Ishades,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gen. 44.31.</note> we <hi>translate</hi> it the <hi>Grave,</hi> but it is the same Word that is used for <hi>Hell</hi> in the <hi>Text.</hi> And thus the Word is used in other places of <hi>Scripture,</hi> as also in other <hi>Authors,</hi> to signifie the Place and State of the <hi>Dead,</hi> and of se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate Souls. And for the lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the Soul of Christ in <hi>Hades,</hi> or in <hi>Hell,</hi> we must know, that it is a thing that is not unusual in <hi>Scripture,</hi> to call a Man that is <hi>dead</hi> by the Name of <hi>Soul:</hi> So the <hi>Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuagint</hi> translate that place in <hi>Levi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticus,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Levit. 21.11.</note>

               <pb n="106" facs="tcp:206211:64"/>If we take <hi>Hell</hi> for the <hi>Grave,</hi> we must take the <hi>Soul</hi> for the <hi>Body, Thou wilt not leave my Body in the Grave:</hi> But if by <hi>Hell</hi> be here understood the State of <hi>Death,</hi> that is, the State of Separation of <hi>Soul</hi> and <hi>Body,</hi> the Interpretation will be more easie and natural, <hi>Thou wilt not leave my Soul</hi> in a State of Separation from the <hi>Body,</hi> but wilt certainly unite them together a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, and raise me up before I shall feel Corruption. Thus I have given you the Interpretation of the <hi>Prophecy</hi> of <hi>David,</hi> which, upon the Account of God's Truth and Veracity, was to take effect in the <hi>Resurrection</hi> of our Saviour; and therefore being foretold <hi>he should not see Corruption,</hi> the Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness of God was obliged within that time inviolably to raise him up. And that is the second <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi> why it was impossible Christ

            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Another <hi>Argument</hi> is this: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="III"/>
               <note place="margin">God's Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice would not suffer Christ to lie in the Grave.</note>
               <hi>It was impossible Christ could be holden by Death, upon the Account of God's Justice.</hi> For Justice, as it doth ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige to inflict Punishment upon the Guilty, so also to absolve and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quit the Innocent. Now, though Christ <hi>knew no Sin,</hi> yet was he <hi>made Sin for us;</hi> that is, our Sins were imputed to, and charged upon him, and so, through a vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary Susception and Underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of them, he became guilty of them: Hereupon Divine Justice seized upon him, as being our Surety, and demanded Satisfaction from him for our Offences: Now no other Satisfaction would be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:206211:65"/>unto God, nor commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surate to our Sins, but the bearing of an infinite Load of Wrath and Vengeance; which if it had been laid upon us, must have been pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed to an Eternity of Suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings; for because we are finite Creatures, we cannot bear infinite Degrees of Wrath at once, and therefore we must have lain under those infinite Degrees of Wrath to an infinite Duration: But now Christ being God, he could bear the Load of infinite Degrees of Wrath at once upon him. In that one bitter Draught, the whole Cup of that Fury and Wrath of God, that we should have been everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stingly a drinking off, by little Drops, Christ drank off at once. Now it is the <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>Constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of all <hi>Laws,</hi> that when a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son by undergoing the Penalty that those Laws require, hath made
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:206211:65"/>satisfaction for the Offence com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, the Person satisfying ought to be protected as innocent. It could not therefore consist with the <hi>Justice of God,</hi> that when Christ had satisfied his utmost Demands, that any of the punishment due to our Sins, for which he satisfied, should have lain upon him lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger; for that would have been no other than punishing without an Offence. Now nothing is clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer in <hi>Scripture,</hi> than that <hi>Death</hi> is a punishment inflicted upon us for Sin: So says the Apostle;<note place="margin">

               <hi>The Wages of Sin is Death.</hi> And in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther place,<note place="margin">and 5.12.</note>
               <hi>By Sin Death enter'd into the World, and Death passed upon all, because all have sinned.</hi> From all which it follows, that as Christ ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king upon him our Sins, became thereby liable to <hi>Death;</hi> so having satisfied for our Sins, and thereby freed himself from the Guilt that
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:206211:66"/>he lay under by Imputation, he was no longer liable unto <hi>Death,</hi> which is one part of the punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment he underwent; so that it could not have been agreeable to infinite Justice, that Christ should have been holden of <hi>Death,</hi> who by his undergoing of <hi>Death,</hi> hath sustai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the whole Load of God's in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite Wrath and Displeasure, and fully satisfied for all those Sins that were imputed to him, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ought in justice to be acquit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from all Penalties, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quentially from Death.</p>

               <hi>It was impossible Christ should be holden of Death,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Christ could not be holden of Death, because of his Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torship.</note> in respect of his <hi>Ossice</hi> of <hi>Mediatorship:</hi> For having as our Mediator underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken the desperate Service of bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing sinfull and fallen Man to Life and Happiness, he must of necessity not only <hi>dye</hi> but <hi>rise again</hi> from the <hi>dead,</hi> without which his Death
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:206211:66"/>and whatever else he did or suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for us, would have been of no avail. There are two Things re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite, before any real or eternal Benefit can become ours.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> A meritorious purchase, procuring the Thing it self for us.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> An effectual Applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that Benefit to us.

The Loss of Christ's Life would not have
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:206211:67"/>procured Life for us, unless as he laid it down with Freedom; so he had again restored it with Power. Our hope of Salvation otherwise would have been buried in the same Grave with himself; but what he died to procure, he lives to confer. It was Ignorance of <hi>Christ's Resurrection from the Dead,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Luk. 24.16, 19, 20, 21.</note> that so stagger'd the two <hi>Disciples</hi> going to <hi>Emaus:</hi> They tell Christ himself a sad Story of one <hi>Jesus of Nazareth,</hi> that was condemned and crucified, who, while he lived a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong us, by his Word and Works testified himself to be the true <hi>Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siah,</hi> we little thought of his Dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and when he told us of his <hi>Death,</hi> he likewise foretold us of his <hi>Resurrection the third Day;</hi> and behold, the <hi>third Day</hi> is already come, and yet is there no Appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of this Jesus: <hi>Verily, we trusted that it had been he which should have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:206211:67"/>
               <pb facs="tcp:206211:68"/>
               <pb n="113" facs="tcp:206211:68"/>Israel; but now our Hopes grow faint, and languish in us; for certainly, there can be no <hi>Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> for <hi>Israel</hi> by him who cannot redeem himself from Death. There was nothing in the World did so much prejudice the <hi>Gospel,</hi> and hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der its taking place in the Hearts of <hi>Heathens</hi> in the <hi>Primitive Times,</hi> as this of the Cross and Death of Christ; for believing that he was lifted up upon the <hi>Cross,</hi> but not believing that he was raised up from the <hi>Dead,</hi> they assented to their <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Reason,</hi> which herein taught them, That it was Folly to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect Life from him who could not either preserve or restore his own.</p>
            <p>It is true, it was Folly thus to hope, but that his Life applies what his Death deserv'd; and our Salvation begun on the Cross, is perfected on the Throne. And
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:206211:69"/>therefore the <hi>Apostle</hi> tells us,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 15.17.</note> our Faith in a crucified Saviour, and our Obedience to him is all vain, if he had not risen again from the Dead: For unless he had risen from the Dead, he could not have acquitted us from the Guilt of Sin, because he could not have been ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified himself. We are justified by the Righteousness of Christ, as the <hi>Apostle</hi> speaks,<note place="margin">Rom. 4.25</note> in his Epistle to the <hi>Romans;</hi> which Righteousness he wrought out for us, both by his perfect Obedience to the Law, and by his Submission to the Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Law: But yet this Righteousness could not have avai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to our Justification, had he not, after the Fulfilling of it, risen again from the Dead; because he himself had not been justified, much less could we have been ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified by one who could not have justified himself. And therefore
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:206211:69"/>we read,<note place="margin">1 Tim. 3.16.</note>
               <hi>Great is the Mystery of Godliness,</hi> says the <hi>Apostle; God ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifested in the Flesh,</hi> in his Incarna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; <hi>justified in the Spirit,</hi> by his Resurrection; <hi>seen of Angels,</hi> in his Ascension. Had he not been rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed and quickned by the Spirit, that is, by the glorious Power of his Divine Nature, he had not been declared just, nor could he have justified us: For this Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, that Christ was just, was made upon the Resurrection of his Body from the Dead, by which he was set free from all those Penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties due to our Sins that were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to him. If therefore the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification and Salvation of Sinners was a Design laid by the infinite Wisdom of God, it must needs fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that it was impossible for Christ to be kept under Death, because that would have obstructed their Justification and Salvation,
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:206211:70"/>and so would have brought a Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointment upon the infinite Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God, which was impossible to be done; and therefore conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quentially Christ could not be hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den of Death.</p>

               <hi>We command you, Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, in the Name of our Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ, that you withdraw your selves from every Brother that walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth disorderly, and not after the Tradition which he received of us.</hi> And this way of reproving them ought to be so managed by us, that it may appear it doth not proceed from any sowre, morose, surly Humour, disdaining or ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of their Persons, but merely from Conscience of our Duty towards the Glory of God, and to do an Act of Love and Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, as indeed it is, both to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them, and towards our selves.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Towards them: When you thus endeavour to shame them out of their Wickedness, by discountenancing them in it. So says the <hi>Apostle,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Thess. 3.14.</note>
               <hi>If any Man obey not our Word, note that Man,
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:206211:75"/>and have no Company with him, that he may be ashamed.</hi> And indeed, if a Man be not altogether pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fligate, if he be not utterly lost to Modesty, it must needs make him reflect upon himself with Shame and Blushing, that cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly he is grown a strange vile Wretch, a loathsome and odious Monster, when all good and so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber Men do thus carefully shun and avoid him. Now Shame is a good step to Amendment: And a Blush the first colour that Virtue takes.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Towards your selves: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> You are obliged to abandon them, as to reclaim them, so to secure your selves: For <hi>Vice</hi> is very contagious, and it is unsafe to converse with those, who have such Plague-Sores running upon them, lest you be also in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected.</p>
            <pb n="128" facs="tcp:206211:76"/>
            <p>Thus you see what this Duty of <hi>Brotherly Reproof</hi> is, and how in the general it is to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, either in Words or Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. And to these, Two Things are necessarily previous and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecedent,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Instruction and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction.<note place="margin">Conviction of the Fault.</note> We ought to bring them to see their Fault before we rebuke them for it; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise while we chide and do not inform them, it will rather seem a proud design of quarrelling with them, than a conscientious Design of bettering them. And therefore we find how artificial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Nathan</hi> insinuates into <hi>David</hi> the hainousness and inhumani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of his Sin, and works in him a Hatred and Detestation of that Person who was so cruel and devoid of Compassion, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he comes to deal downright

               <hi>Secondly,</hi>

               <note place="margin">We ought to watch over our Brother.</note> It is necessary that we watch over our Brother, not so as to be insidious Spies upon him, officiously to pry into his Actions, and busily concern our selves in all he doth. This prag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical Temper is justly hate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful. And those who thus arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate to themselves to be publick Censors, and to inspect the

               <note place="margin">By Caution.</note> We ought so to watch over our Brother as to give him timely Caution if we see him in any danger through Temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or Passion, and to admonish him to stand upon his guard, to recollect himself and beware he be not surprized or injured by such an approaching Sin.</p>
            <p>And <hi>Secondly,</hi>

For he that will ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:206211:78"/>rashly to reprove without this Circumspection, may do more mischief to his Brother by rebuking him, than he had done to himself by offending: Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperating and imbittering his Heart against Piety, for the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinencies, at least the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>discretions of those who profess it, and provoking him to sin the more out of mere Opposition and Contradiction. And I am verily perswaded, and have in some Cases observed it, that ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry many Sins owe themselves to the imprudence of those who have taken upon themselves to be Reprovers, and would never have been committed, if they had not indiscreetly gainsay'd it. Thus we see what this Duty of reproving is, and what is neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarily required thereunto.</p>
            <pb n="132" facs="tcp:206211:79"/>
            <p>But indeed, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> which is the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Thing,<note place="margin">Of the difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Reproof.</note> It is not so hard a Matter to know what it is, as it is difficult conscientiously and faithfully to practise it. How few are there in the World, I will not say skillful enough to do it well, but zealous and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scientious enough to do it at all? Do we not every day see God fearfully dishonoured, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve his Name blasphemed, his Laws violated, his Worship de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied? Do you not daily see mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes of wretched Creatures, whose Crimes not only defie and outrage God, but stab and mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther their own Souls; and yet who is there that hath that Zeal for God, or that Charity for his Brother, as to interpose, and by a serious and fitting Reproof, vindicate the one from Disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, or rescue the other from
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:206211:79"/>Perdition? There are enow that will make up a sad Mouth, and whisper those things abroad, it may be out of very ill Ends and Designs: but where almost is the Person that will dare to maintain the Honour of God to the Face of those who bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly affront him; that will dare to open their Mouths before those that will dare to open them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Heaven? Certainly we can easily produce much more Reason for our Reproofs, than they can for their Wickedness, and it were very strange, if we should not be able to beat them off from their Considence, when we have God and our own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences, nay and theirs also, to side with us. Yet so it is that we are generally apt to sneak and slink away from so troublesome a Task, and to let
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:206211:80"/>Iniquity pass uncontroul'd, yea triumphant. We are well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to let others sin quietly, so that we may live quietly without troubling our selves with so hard and difficult a Service. And that which makes it seem so dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult, is,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> A sinful Fear; and,</p>

               <hi>Secondly,</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> A sinful Shame, that seizeth on the Spirits of Men, and takes off the edge of holy Courage and Confidence, that are so absolutely necessary to the performing of this Duty.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Many are afraid to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove Sin,<note place="margin">Fear of displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing should not hinder repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving for Sin.</note> lest they should in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur Displeasure, weaken their secular Interest, ruine their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendencies, and bring some Mischief upon themselves, by exasperating the Offenders a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst them. But these are poor, low, carnal Considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:206211:80"/>Where Matter of Duty is in question, it is very neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary for every Christian to be of an undaunted Courage and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution, not to fear the Faces of Men, nor to be frighted with a grim Look, or a proud Huff. If he will seriously perform this Duty, he must remember, that he is pleading for God, that he is saving a Soul from Hell, and therefore ought not to value their Anger, nor his own Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage; but to steel himself a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst all such mean and sordid Considerations. Indeed it shews a most pitiful Spirit in us, that we should be more afraid of of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending them, than they are of offending God. Shall they be bold to sin, and we not bold e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to tell them of it? And yet such is the Cowardize of the Generality of Christians, that
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:206211:81"/>they dare not appear for God, or for Piety and Holiness, when they see them wronged by the Impudence of boisterous Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners; but those pitiful, little base carnal Respects of what they may lose, or what they may suffer by it, intervene, and make them sit mopish, and over-aw'd, <hi>like Men in whose Mouths are no Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofs;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psal. 38.14.</note> whilst these wicked Wretches, who have all the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son in the World to be timorous and fearful, glory in thus out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braving and baffling them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Others again are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shamed to reprove Sin.<note place="margin">Shame should not hinder Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving for Sin.</note> And whereas many vile and profli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate Wretches glory in their Shame, these on the contrary are ashamed of that which would be their Glory. Either they doubt they shall be thought but troublesome and hypocritical
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:206211:81"/>Intermedlers; or else possibly being conscious to themselves of many Miscarriages, they suspect their <hi>Reproofs</hi> will be upbraidingly retorted upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, and so by reproving the Faults of others, they shall but give an occasion to have their own ript up and exposed: And so they think it the safer way to say nothing, lest by raking into other Mens Dunghills, they should but furnish them with Dirt enough to fling back in their own Faces. And thus between these Two carnal Principles of <hi>sinful Fear,</hi> and <hi>sinful Shame,</hi> which are so deeply rooted in our corrupt Natures, <hi>Reproof</hi> is commonly neglected, and it is one of the hardest things in the World, to perswade Men to be true to God, to their own Souls, and to the Souls of their Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:206211:82"/>in a faithful discharge of that Duty which is usually at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with such Disadvantages and Difficulties.</p>
            <p>But though it be thus diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult; yet,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> It is a most necessary Duty.<note place="margin">Reproof a very necessary Duty.</note> The greatest good you can do in the World is to pluck up these Bryars and Thorns with which it is over-grown. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider but how insolent Vice and Wickedness is apt to be where none do appear to check and controul it. If it can but once silence Vertue, it will quickly banish it. If it can but put it to the Blush, it will quickly put it to flight. And when it hath once made us either afraid or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shamed to lay a Rebuke in its way, what else can we expect but that it should overspread the Face of the whole Earth, and
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:206211:82"/>like a general Deluge drown all Mankind, first in Sin, and then in Perdition. There is no other way to prevent this great and sad Ruine, but for every Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an vigorously to oppose himself to the growing Sins of the Times and Places in which he lives, and with Courage and Resolution to decry that common Profane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, that gains Credit only by our Silence. We know that Sin is a shameful opprobrious Thing in it self, a Thing that dishear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tens and dispirits the Guilty: They wear a <hi>Conscience</hi> about them that is still checking and upbraiding them; and if we could but look into their Souls, we should see them covered all over with Fear, Horrour, and Confusion. They are general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly self-condemned Persons, and carry those Monitors within
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:206211:83"/>their own Breasts that are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually reproving and tormen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them: And therefore that they may not hear the Voice of their own Consciences, they live abroad, and rather converse with any one without doors, than with themselves and their own troublesome and clamo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Hearts. Now let it be our Care to stop up all Passa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, by which they think to make their escape. Let them find, that in whatsoever Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany they go, they shall meet with those that will no more spare them, than their own <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences;</hi> that Company is no Sanctuary for Sins and Guilt, and that they shall be as sure to be <hi>Reproved,</hi> as they dare to <hi>Offend.</hi> And when they are thus every-where beset, their <hi>Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences</hi> exclaiming against them
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:206211:83"/>within, and all that they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse with without, they will see a Necessity for it, either to forsake their <hi>Vices,</hi> or the <hi>World,</hi> and be forced to be vertuous for their own ease and quiet. And certainly till Christians do conspire together in this Design, we may long enough complain of the abounding of Iniquity without any successful Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Abound it will, and grow impudent and imperious, unless we join together to beat down its Credit, expose it to Scorn and Contempt, and make that which is so really shameful in it self, to be the greatest Mark of Infamy, Shame, and Reproach to any that shall dare to commit it.</p>
            <p>But now this Duty of <hi>Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving,</hi> requires not only a great deal of Christian <hi>Fortitude</hi> and <hi>Courage,</hi> but also a great mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:206211:84"/>of Christian <hi>Prudence</hi> and <hi>Discretion.</hi> We must not only be resolute and confident in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, but we must do it like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise in such a fitting way as may be most likely to work a good effect upon those whom we are to <hi>reprove.</hi> And therefore,</p>
            <p>In the Fourth Place, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> I shall give you some brief Rules and Directions,<note place="margin">Rules for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof.</note> when you ought to <hi>reprove,</hi> and how you ought to manage your <hi>Reproofs,</hi> so as they may be most beneficial to your Brother.

            </p>

               <hi>First,</hi>

And therefore those who upon a blind Rumour, or groundless Suspici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:206211:84"/>hastily conclude him guilty, and so fill their Mouths with Reproofs, shew themselves to be very much in love with this Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, and are a company of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent Busie-bodies, who start their Arrow before ever they see the Mark. We must first be cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly informed, either upon our Personal Knowledge, or upon the undoubted Testimonies of credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Witnesses, that he is Guilty; otherwise in going about to shew him his <hi>Fault,</hi> we shall but shew our own <hi>Folly,</hi> and Credulity, our <hi>Reproofs</hi> will be but <hi>Slanders,</hi> and our Charity in offering the Cure, will not be half so great, as our uncharitableness in belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the Disease.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> It is not necessary for me to reprove, where I have rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to conclude that others of more Prudence and Interest in

And besides, too many Reprovers may, instead of reforming, rather irritate and provoke: Only here, beware thou dost not retract this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful Office, upon slight Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences, nor think thy self excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, because others are bound to do it. But consider seriously in thine own Conscience, whether thou thinkest they will be faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful enough in performing it, or more dextrous than thou art in managing it; or that their <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof</hi> will be more acceptable and more prevalent with thy Brother than thine. If not, thou art still obliged to it: And if thou

               <pb n="145" facs="tcp:206211:86"/>refusest, know, that though he may die in his Sins, yet his Blood God will require at thy Hands. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>

<pb n="146" facs="tcp:206211:87"/>do it for lesser Sins, than possibly we can. To reprove small Faults with great vehemence, is always as ridiculous, and may sometimes prove as destructive a piece of Officiousness, as his who took up a huge Beetle, and struck with all his Might, only to kill a Fly he saw sticking upon his Friends Forehead. We must not thrust the <hi>Probe</hi> deep where the Wound is but shallow: Nor be passionately concern'd at our Brother's lighter Failings; but so govern our selves, as still to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve the more sharp and severe <hi>Reproofs</hi> for the more foul and scandalous Offences.

<pb n="150" facs="tcp:206211:89"/>obliged in Conscience, instant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to rebuke them for it, although not only they themselves may be reviled, but the Name of God most horribly blasphemed upon this very Occasion, It is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed <hi>good to be zealously affected always in a good Matter.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gal. 4.18.</note> But yet withal know, that as Zeal and Charity ought to be the Motive, so Christian Prudence ought to be the Measure of all our <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofs.</hi> And if you take not the Advice of Discretion, your Zeal for God's Glory may but occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion his Dishonour; and your Charity to the Souls of others, occasion their sorer Ruine and Damnation, Certainly we are not obliged to reprove where we have reason to suspect we shall rather do hurt than good. It would be but a cruel Charity, to poison our Brother in his
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:206211:89"/>
               <hi>Physick,</hi> and to kill him in his Cure. And therefore both <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon,</hi> and a greater than <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi> our <hi>Saviour Christ</hi> himself, have forbidden us to misplace <hi>Reproofs</hi> upon those who are desperate. <hi>Solomon</hi> tells us,<note place="margin">Prov. 9.7.</note>
               <hi>He that reproveth a Scorner, getteth to himself Shame; and he that rebuketh a wicked Man, getteth unto himself a Blot.</hi> And again, <hi>Reprove not a Scorner, lest he hate thee.</hi> And says our Saviour,<note place="margin">Matth. 7.6.</note>
               <hi>Give not that which is Holy unto Dogs, neither cast ye your Pearls before Swine, lest they trample them under their Feet, and turn again and rent you.</hi> Where it is very plain from the precedent Verses, that he dehorts us from lavishing out our <hi>Reproofs</hi> impru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently upon <hi>Dogs</hi> and <hi>Swine.</hi> Wicked and impure Persons, on whom we have reason to think they will have no effect, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:206211:90"/>to inrage them, and make them fly out both against God and us, with the more Violence and Madness. To <hi>reprove</hi> such, <hi>is</hi> but to cast up Water against an high Wind, that will be sure to beat it back again into our own Faces.</p>
            <p>And thus I have given you the <hi>Negative Rules</hi> in these four Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars. Reprove not without a certain knowledge of the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence. Nor where others who are likely to be more effectual, have done it already. Nor for every involuntary slip. Nor those who are like to be the worse for it.</p>
            <p>Let us now proceed to lay down some <hi>Positive Rules</hi> and <hi>Directions</hi> for the right managing of our <hi>Reproofs.</hi> And here,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
               <note place="margin">Time and Place must be observed in giving Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof.</note> If thou wouldst re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove with success, observe right Circumstances of Time and
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:206211:90"/>Place: And let the one be as opportune, and the other as private as thou canst. We ought to observe the <hi>mollia tempora fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>di,</hi> the soft and easy Hours of speaking. And therefore the wise Man tells us,<note place="margin">Prov. 15.23.</note>
               <hi>A Word spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in season, how good is it? It is like Apples of Gold in Pictures of Silver,</hi> that is, very beautiful and pleasing. There are some hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py Seasons wherein the most rugged Natures are accessible; and it is a great part of Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in all our Concerns, if we would have them prosperous, to watch such Opportunities, and to improve them.</p>
            <p>Now usually it is no fit sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son for Reproof,<note place="margin">Reproof not seasonable,</note>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Presently as soon as the Sin is committed;<note place="margin">As soon as the Sin is committed.</note> for then the heat is not over, nor the uproar of the Passions and Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:206211:91"/>appeased. In all like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lihood a <hi>Reproof</hi> as yet would but irritate. As Water falling upon a red hot Iron, doth but cause a great deal of Noise and Disturbance: So a <hi>Reproof</hi> just upon the very Act of a Sin, doth but make the Sinner fume, estu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate and tumultuate the more. Nor yet,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Is a Time of Mirth and Joy fit for <hi>Reproof;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Reproof un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seasonable in a time of Mirth.</note> for that will look like a piece of Envy, as if we were malicious at their Prosperity, and therefore studied to cast in somewhat that might disturb them; and so they will be apt to interpret it. Nor,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
               <note place="margin">Reproof un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seasonable in a time of Sorrow.</note> Is a Time of exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing great Sadness and Sorrow, a proper Season for <hi>Reproof;</hi> for this will look like Hostility and Hatred, as if we designed utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to overwhelm and dispatch them.</p>
            <pb n="155" facs="tcp:206211:91"/>
            <p>But the fittest opportunity for this Duty,<note place="margin">Reproof most seasonable when Persons are most calm and sedate.</note> is when they are most calm and sedate, their Passions husht, and their Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son (with which you are to deal) again reseated upon its Throne. When they are free from all inward Perturbations of Mind, and from all considerable Alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations in their outward Estate and Condition. Then, if ever, they will listen to <hi>Reproof,</hi> and take right Measures of the Sin for which you <hi>reprove</hi> them. But if we <hi>reprove</hi> them when their Passions are in a Tumult, and all within in an Uproar and Combustion, it is no wonder at all if either they reject or revile our <hi>Reproofs;</hi> for we then ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse them before very corrupt Judges, <hi>viz.</hi> their own Passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and corrupt Affections. And you may with as much
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:206211:92"/>Reason, and as good Success, chide the Sea for being Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pestuous, when the Winds rage and are let loose upon it. Chide a Man for being angry when he is angry, and what will you get by it, but only some of his foam cast upon you? Let God himself expostulate with an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patient <hi>Jonah,</hi> whilst he is in his fit of Impatience:<note place="margin">Jonah 4.9.</note>
               <hi>Doest thou well to be angry?</hi> and he will tell him snappishly to his Face, <hi>That he doth well to be angry, even to the very Death.</hi> There is no dealing with Men while their Passions blind their Reason; This makes them as utterly incapable of taking good Counsel, as if they were brute Beasts. Thou wert as good thrust thy Hand into a <hi>Wasps Nest,</hi> as come with <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofs</hi> and <hi>Rebukes</hi> when the Swarm is up, to be sure thou
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:206211:92"/>shalt only go away with many a Sting and Wound, and thou mayest thank thy self for no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter timing thy <hi>Reproofs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Indeed in Cases of great Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance and absolute Necessity, we may run this Venture, and possibly succeed well in it. Thus <hi>Joab</hi> very sharply reproved <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Sam. 19.5, 6, 7.</note> when he so immoderately mourned for <hi>Absalom.</hi> And I think it is one of the roundest Checks that ever a dutiful <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject</hi> gave to his <hi>Prince;</hi> but if he had not taken that very time, the Case had been desperate, and his People had all forsaken him, and therefore the necessity of Affairs would not permit him to expect a more season<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Address. Otherwise gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally, it is more adviseable to wait a fitting and cool time. As God is said to come down <hi>in the
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:206211:93"/>cool of the Day</hi> to reprove <hi>Adam.</hi> So likewise should we come in the cool season of a Man's Passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, when all is quiet and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate within, for then is there the greatest probability of Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> If thou wouldst have thy Reproofs successful,<note place="margin">Reproof must be with Gentleness and Meekness.</note> reprove with all Gentleness and Meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, without giving any railing or reviling Terms. He that mingles Reproach with <hi>Reproof,</hi> engages a Man's Reputation to side with his Vices: For whilst we shew any Bitterness in our <hi>Reproofs,</hi> and give them in vili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying and ignominious Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, the Vehicle will hinder the Operation of the Physick. For they will look like the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braidings of an Enemy; and it is a thing most abhorrent unto Nature, to follow the Counsels
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:206211:93"/>and Advice of an Enemy. And therefore the <hi>Apostle</hi> chargeth us, <hi>Brethren,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gal. 6.1.</note>
               <hi>if a Man be overtaken in a fault, you that are spiritual, restore such an one in the spirit of Meekness, considering thy self, lest thou be also tempted.</hi> Which last Clause inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates to us, that we ought to deal as tenderly with a fallen Brother, as we would desire to be dealt with our selves, were we in the same condition. For having the same corrupt Nature, and being subject to the like Temptations, we may likewise, through God's dereliction of us, fall into the same Miscarriages. Now wouldst thou take it well, if any should revile and reprove thee, condemn thee for a rotten Hypocrite, as <hi>Job</hi>'s Friends did him; or draw hideous black Consequences from every failing and weakness of thine? Certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:206211:94"/>thou wouldst not interpret this to be friendly and candid deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: No more do thou with others. It is a true Saying, That he who would know his own Faults, had need have either a faithful Friend, or a bitter Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my; they will both be sure to do it to the full. But then the difference is, that an Enemy's <hi>Reproofs</hi> are usually joined with <hi>Reproaches,</hi> and when we are fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len, he will stand and insult over us. But a true Christian Friend will faithfully represent our condition to us, pitty us in it, and endeavour to help and raise us out of it. And such should we be to all, not railing on them for Hypocrites, or lost and desperate Apostates; for this certainly is not the way to reduce them, but rather to confirm and harden them in their Sins. We
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:206211:94"/>should not gripe nor press their Wounds, but rather gently anoint and chafe them. Our <hi>Reproofs</hi> should be as Oyl, smooth and lenitive, to soak into and supple the Part affected. And therefore the <hi>Apostle</hi> again exhorts us, <hi>in meekness to instruct those that oppose themselves.</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Tim. 2.25.</note> But whilst we ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim against them with bitter Invectives, and dip all our <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofs</hi> in Gall and <hi>Satyr,</hi> we may quickly make them loath the Medicine rather than the Disease, and sooner break their Heads with such Rebukes, than their Hearts for their Offences.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Though our <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofs</hi> must be meek and gentle,<note place="margin">Reproof must be quick and vivacious.</note> yet must they be quick and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vacious also. For as Charity requires the one, so doth Zeal the other: And the best and most equal Temper, is rightly
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:206211:95"/>to mix these two, that at once we may shew Meekness to his Person,<note place="margin">James 1.20.</note>
               <hi>(for the Wrath of Man worketh not the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness of God)</hi> and Sharpness against his Sin, (for a remiss Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prover will but make a slow Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent.) We ought so to reprove, that he may not think we only jest and dally with him, and for this it is necessary that we do it with all Seriousness, Gravity and Authority, not playing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Wound, but searching into the very depth and bottom of it. And therefore we must use such words as are most sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificant of our meaning, most expressive of our Grief and Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row for him, and which we think most apt to expose the <hi>Vice</hi> that we <hi>reprove,</hi> and make it most odious and hateful, keeping still within the bounds
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:206211:95"/>of a sober and friendly Redar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gution. Hence the <hi>Apostle</hi> gives <hi>Titus</hi> this Advice,<note place="margin">Tit. 1.13.</note>
               <hi>Rebuke them sharply, that they may be sound in the Faith.</hi> If they want Salt and Vinegar, spare them not. This possibly may cleanse those Wounds that else would fester and putrify. But here is required much spiritual Prudence to know how to suit <hi>Reproof,</hi> according to the different Conditions and Tempers of the Persons you deal with. Some must be launcht and searcht to the very Quick before they can be healed. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers require a gentle Hand. If they be proud and stubborn, they need Corrosives. But for those who are naturally meek and mild, a meek and mild Course will be easiest and most effectual. The Tempers and Cases of particular Christians
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:206211:96"/>are so various, that there can be no Rules given that may be applicable to every Condition. This must of necessity be left to your Prudence and Discre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Only this Rule is infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, Be sure you flatter none in their Vices, extenuate not their Sins; when thou com'st to <hi>reprove</hi> them, do it not in sport: Let them see thou art in very good earnest, and tell them their Sin, as it is in it self, without min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing the matter, or the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances of it. For Men are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways apt to impute somewhat of the <hi>Reproof</hi> to the severity of him that gives it, rather than to the demerits of their own Offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. And therefore, if thou thy self shalt speak but slightly of their Sins, they will be ready to conclude that they were none, or at least so small, that it was
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:206211:96"/>nothing but Officiousness, and the love of Censuring made thee take notice of them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Reproof ought to be given pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately.</note> Let all thy <hi>Reproofs</hi> be given as secretly and privately as possibly thou canst; otherwise thou wilt seem not so much to aim at thy Brother's Reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as at his Shame and Confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion. For if (as the Wiseman tells us) a loud and clamorous Benediction given too officious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,<note place="margin">Prov. 27.14.</note> is so far from being a Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing, that it is but a Curse and a Shame to a Man's Friend. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly then a publick clamorous <hi>Reproof</hi> must only tend to the Shame and Reproach of them that receive it. Indeed there are some who offend openly before many: These, (if there be no fear of irritating them to do worse) we ought openly to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buke, and to give them their
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:206211:97"/>
               <hi>Reproof</hi> in the Company where they have given the <hi>Offence,</hi> so saith the Apostle,<note place="margin">1 Tim. 5.20.</note>
               <hi>Those that Sin rebuke before all;</hi> that is, suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing that their Sins be open and publick. But for others whose Sins and Miscarriages have been private, and only known to our selves and a few others, we ought to reprove them in secret, and to be tender not only of their Souls, but of their Reputation also. So is the Counsel of our Saviour,<note place="margin">Matth. 18.15.</note>
               <hi>If thy Brother shall tres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass against thee, go and tell him his Fault between thee and him alone.</hi> And indeed this is a necessary piece of Prudence, not only to preserve his Reputation and good Name as much as may be, but also,</p>

Upon all
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:206211:98"/>these Accounts it is necessary that thy <hi>Reproofs</hi> be managed with the greatest Secrecy and Priva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy that may be: For as St. <hi>Austin</hi> speaks well, <q>If whilst thou alone knowest thy Brother to have offended, and yet wilt rebuke him before all, <hi>Non es corrector, sed proditor:</hi> Thou art not a Reprover, but a Betrayer.</q>

               <hi>Is it fit to say to a King, Thou art wicked, and to Princes, Ye are ungodly?</hi> And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed in this Case usually, it is most fit and decent that thy <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="3 letters">

                  </gap>s</hi> should not carry their own
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:206211:98"/>Shape and Form, but disguise them rather into Parables or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treaties, or into any such hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and becoming Method: Yet withal, let so much appear, as that they may well enough know thy drift and intent. For it becomes the Wisdom and Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Inferiours, so to order their Speech, that if it can but be interpreted as a <hi>Reproof,</hi> their Superiours may and will certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly know they meant it for such. Thus the <hi>Apostle</hi> bids us,<note place="margin">1 Tim. 5.1.</note>
               <hi>Rebuke not an Elder, but rather intreat him as a Father.</hi> For because their Place and Calling required Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect and Reverence, therefore the <hi>Apostle</hi> would not have them bluntly Rebuked, but that the <hi>Reproof</hi> should be clad in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther dress, that they might ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to be rather Intreaties than Rebukes.</p>
            <pb n="170" facs="tcp:206211:99"/>
            <p>We may observe likewise, that when <hi>Nathan</hi> was sent im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately by God to reprove King <hi>David,</hi> he doth not attack him directly, and fall rudely up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him for his Adultery and Murder, but cloaths his Speech in a Parable, and when he had so represented the heinousness of his Sin, so as by that means to make him first reprove and condemn himself, then he tells him, <hi>Thou art the Man.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sixthly,</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> If thou wouldst have thy <hi>Reproofs</hi> effectual,<note place="margin">We must not be guilty of the Sins we reprove others for.</note> especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly beware that thou thy self art not guilty of those Sins which thou reprovest in another. It were indeed a Temper to be wish'd and pray'd for, that we could only respect how righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous the <hi>Reproof</hi> were, and not how righteous the Person is who gives it. For there is no
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:206211:99"/>more reason to reject sound Admonition, because it comes from an unfound Heart, than there is to stop our Ears against good Counsel because it is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered perhaps by an unsavou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Breath. Yet so it is, that when Men of defiled Conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and Conversations reprove others, they are apt to justifie themselves by recriminating, or else to think they do but sport and jest with them: Or thirdly to hate them for gross Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites and Dissemblers; or last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, to think they do but envy them their Sins, and that they would ingross all to themselves. It was a true Observation of <hi>Pliny</hi> in his <hi>Epistles,</hi> Lib. 8. Epist. 22. That there are some, <hi>Qui sic aliorum visitis irascuntur, quasi in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>videant:</hi> Who are so angry at o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Mens Vices, as if they
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:206211:100"/>envied them. It cannot be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped that the <hi>Reproof</hi> of such should ever take place. But when a Man of a clear and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spotted Name shall <hi>reprove</hi> the Sins and Vices of others, his <hi>Rebukes</hi> carry Authority with them, and if they cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form; yet at least must they needs daunt and silence the Offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, that they shall have nothing to reply, no Subterfuges nor E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vasions, but they must needs be convinced that their Sins are as evil, as he represents them by his own Care and Caution to be avoided.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> The only Thing that remains is to propound to you some <hi>Motives</hi> that may quicken you to the conscientious dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of this much neglected Duty.<note place="margin">Motives for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving our Brother.</note> And I shall but name some few, and leave them to
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:206211:100"/>your consideration to be farther prest upon you. And here next to the express Command of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God, whose Authority a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone ought to prevail against all the Difficulties that we either find or fancy in the way of Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience thereunto:</p>
            <p>Consider, <hi>First,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Benefit of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving others.</note> the great be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit that may redound both to the <hi>Reprover,</hi> and <hi>Reproved.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> Thou shalt hereby pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide thy self a Friend that may take the same liberty to <hi>reprove</hi> thee, when it shall be needful, and for thy great good. And it may very well be thought that the <hi>Apostle</hi> upon this Account requires us to <hi>Restore our fallen Brother, with meek Reproofs,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gal. 6.1.</note>
               <hi>consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering our selves, lest we also be tempted:</hi> That is, that hereby we may purchase a true Friend, who will be as faithful to us, as
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:206211:101"/>we have been to him. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, certainly it is the best and most generous way of procuring to our selves true Love and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect from those whom we have thus reformed.<note place="margin">Prov. 9.8.</note> So says <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, Rebuke a wise Man, and he will love thee.</hi> And in another place,<note place="margin">Prov. 28.23.</note> says he, <hi>He that rebuketh a Man, afterwards shall find more favour than he that flattereth with his Tongue.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Thou wilt hereby intitle thy self to that great and precious Promise,<note place="margin">Dan. 12.3.</note>
               <hi>That they that be wise, shall shine as the Brightness of the Firmament; and they that turn many to Righteousness, as the Stars for ever and ever.</hi> And to that other of the wise Man, <hi>To them that rebuke the Wicked,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Prov. 24.25.</note>
               <hi>shall be Delight, and a good Blessing shall come upon them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Thou shalt increase thy own Graces and Comforts
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:206211:101"/>more than possibly thou couldst do by separating thy self from them. Thy Graces will be more confirmed, because <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving</hi> of others will engage thee to a greater Watchfulness over thy self. Thy Comforts also will be encreased, because a conscientious discharge of this Duty, will be to thee a great E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of the Integrity and sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity of thy Heart.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> The practice of this Duty will be greatly profitable unto him that is reproved. How knowest thou but it may be a me<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">

            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Tit. 3.3.</note> Consider that we our selves also were disobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent and foolish, serving divers Lusts and Pleasures; but were wrought upon either by pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick or private Reproof. And why then should not we use the same Charity towards others, which God hath been pleased to make effectual towards us.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Consider that the <hi>Text</hi> makes it an apparent sign of hating our Brother, if we forbear justly to reprove him. <hi>Thou shalt not hate thy Brother in thy Heart:</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Joh. 3.15.</note>
               <hi>thou shalt in any wise reprove him.</hi> So that he who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves not his Brother, hates him. Now <hi>he that hates his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is a Murderer,</hi> says St. <hi>John. And no Murderer hath Eternal Life.</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:206211:102"/>
               <pb facs="tcp:206211:103"/>
               <pb n="177" facs="tcp:206211:103"/>Yea, we are guilty of <hi>Soul-Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi> which is so much the more heinous, by how much the Soul is more precious than the Body.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Consider that the performance of this Duty, were it more universal, would be the aptest and readiest means to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent <hi>Schism</hi> and <hi>Division.</hi> The grand pretence for Separation, is the wickedness of many who are <hi>Church-Members.</hi> Now our <hi>Saviour</hi>'s Method is, That such should be first reproved and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monish'd, before they be cast out; but it is a most preposte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and headlong Course that thousands in our Days take, who cast themselves out of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of the <hi>Church,</hi> for the Sins of those who deserve to be cast out; and rather than they will perform this ingrateful Work of <hi>Reproof,</hi> choose to se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate;
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:206211:104"/>whereas if they would make use of our <hi>Saviour Christ</hi>'s Advice,<note place="margin">Mat. 18.15, 16.</note> to reprove privately, and in case of Obstinacy, to convict publickly, there would be, as no need, so no Pretence left for Separation; but either their private Reproofs would prevail to reform, or their pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Complaints and Accusations to remove Offenders.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> Consider, that the neglect of this Duty, brings the Sin and Guilt of others up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on your own Souls. See for this that Scripture,<note place="margin">Eph. 5.11.</note>
               <hi>Ephesians</hi> 5.11. <hi>Have no Fellowship with the unfruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Works of Darkness, but rather reprove them.</hi> If we reprove them not, we are Partakers of their evil Deeds, and deserve to be Partakers of their Torments.</p>

            </epigraph>
            <p>THere are two principal <hi>At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes</hi> of God,<note place="margin">An Intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction.</note> which the <hi>Scripture</hi> propounds to us as the most powerful and effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Motives to restrain us from
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:206211:105"/>Sin: And they are his <hi>Mercy,</hi> and his <hi>Justice; Mercy</hi> tho' it be a soft, yet is it a strong Argument to encourage us to Purity and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness. And therefore says the Apostle,<note place="margin">Rom. 2.4.</note>
               <hi>The Goodness of God leadeth us to Repentance.</hi> And certainly that <hi>Mercy</hi> that expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth it self so ready to pardon Sin, cannot but lay a mighty Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation upon the Ingenuity of a Christian Spirit to abstain from the commission of it. He that can encourage himself in Wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedness, upon the consideration of the infinite Free-Grace of God, doth but spurn those very Bowels that yern towards him, and strike at God with his own Golden Scepter, yea he tears abroad those Wounds which were at first o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened for him, and casts the Blood of his Saviour back again in his Face. But because Inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuity
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:206211:105"/>is perisht from off the Earth, and Men are generally more apt to be wrought upon by Arguments drawn from Fear than Love, therefore the <hi>Scripture</hi> propounds to us the consideration of the dreadful Justice of God arrayed in all the terrible Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances of it, that if Mercy cannot allure us, Justice at least might affright us from our Sins. And as those who are to travel thorow <hi>Wildernesses</hi> and <hi>Deserts,</hi> carry Fire with them to terrifie wild and ravenous Beasts, and to secure themselves from their Assaults: So doth the great God, who hath to deal with brutish Men, Men more savage than wild Beasts, he kindles a Fire about him, and appears to them all in Flames and Fury; that so he might fright them from their bold Attempts, who other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:206211:106"/>would be ready,<note place="margin">Job 15.26.</note>
               <hi>to run upon his Neck and the thick Bosses of his Buckler.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And therefore in the Four pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent <hi>Verses,</hi> we find the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle</hi> threatning most tremendous Judgments against all that should wilfully transgress, after they had received the knowledge of the Truth. He tells us, <hi>there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains no more sacrifice for their Sins:</hi> Nothing to expiate their Guilt, but that they themselves must fall a Burnt-Sacrifice to the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended Justice of God, consu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med with that fiery Indignation that shall certainly seize and prey upon them for ever.<note place="margin">Heb. 10.28, 29.</note> And in <hi>v.</hi> 28, 29. he sets forth the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding Dreadfulness of their Judgment, by a comparison be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween those that violated the <hi>Law of Moses,</hi> and those that <hi>renounce and annul the Law of Christ. He
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:206211:106"/>that despised</hi> Moses<hi>'s Law,</hi> who himself was but a Servant, and his Laws consisted of inferiour and less spiritual Ordinances, yet a Despiser and Transgres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sor of these was <hi>to die without Mercy;</hi> certainly much sorer Judgments await those, who reject the <hi>Laws of Christ,</hi> and trample him who is the <hi>Son</hi> and <hi>Lord</hi> of the House, under foot; accounting his Blood unholy and prophane, renouncing his Merits, and blaspheming the Holy Spirit by which our <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour</hi> acted: Such as these, shall eternally perish with less Mercy, than those that <hi>died without Mercy.</hi> Where observe the strange <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phasis</hi> that the <hi>Apostle</hi> lays upon this dreadful Commination; he tells us they shall be sorer punish'd, than those that are punished with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Mercy; to let us know, that
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:206211:107"/>as there are transcendent Glories, such as <hi>Eye hath not seen, nor Ear heard, nor can it enter into the Heart of Man to</hi> conceive, reserved in the Heavens for those that love God; so are there Woes and Torments, such as <hi>Eye hath not seen, Ear heard, nor can it enter into the Heart of Man to</hi> conceive, how great and insupportable they are, prepared in <hi>Hell</hi> for those that hate him. They shall die with less Mercy, than those that die without Mercy.</p>
            <p>Now that we might not wonder at such a <hi>Paradox</hi> as this, the <hi>Apostle</hi> gives the Reason of it in my Text, <hi>For we know him that hath said, Vengeance belongeth unto me,</hi> it is the Vengeance of God, <hi>and a falling into the Hands of God,</hi> and therefore it is no wonder if their Punishments be beyond all extremity. They fall
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:206211:107"/>under the Power and Wrath of an infinite God, which when we have heaped Superlatives upon Superlatives, yet still we must express defectively, and all that we can conceive of it falls vastly short of reaching but a faint and languishing resemblance thereof. It is a State so full of perfect Misery, that Misery it self is too easy a Name to give it; yea, whatsoever we can speak most appositely of it, is but diminish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it; for because it is the <hi>Wrath</hi> and <hi>Vengeance</hi> of an infinite God, it can no more be known by us, than God himself. Plunge your Thoughts as deep into it as you can, yet still there remains an infinite <hi>Abysse</hi> which you can never fathom. And O that the consideration of this <hi>Wrath</hi> might cause us to tremble before this great and terrible God, that
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:206211:108"/>we Might so fear it, as never to feel it; and be perswaded to fall down at his Feet, that we may never fall into his Hands. And that we may be thus affected, I have chosen this <hi>Text</hi> to set forth the Greatness and Dreadful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of that Wrath and Venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance which the righteous God will execute upon all stubborn and disobedient Wretches.</p>
            <p>A <hi>Text</hi> that speaks to us, as God did to the <hi>Israelites</hi> from <hi>Mount Sinai,</hi> out of the midst of the Fire and Blackness, Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and Tempest, in the Voice of a Trumpet. And truly we have all need to have such rou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing Truths frequently inculca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted upon us, for the best of us are <hi>Lethargical,</hi> and though some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time when our Consciences are pincht hard by a severe and search<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Truth, we start and look a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, yet as soon as the present
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:206211:108"/>Impression is over, we close our Eyes, and fall asleep again in Sin and Security. There is a strange Dullness and Stupor hath seiz'd us, that we can no longer keep waking than we are shook.</p>
            <p>And therefore as we use to apply Fire and burning Coals to <hi>Lethargick</hi> Persons to awaken them; so we have need to heap <hi>Coals of Fire</hi> upon Mens Heads, to speak with <hi>fiery Tongues,</hi> and thunder Woe and Wrath and Judgments against them, that we may rouze the secure stupid World, and scorch them into Life and Sense.</p>
            <p>In the Words we have these two Parts observable.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> An Appropriation of Vengeance unto God, <hi>Vengeance belongeth unto me, I will recompence, saith the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> The Dreadfulness
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:206211:109"/>of that Vengeance inferred, from the consideration of the Author and Inflicter of it, <hi>It is a fearful thing to fall into the Hands of the living God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I begin with the <hi>first</hi> of these, God's appropriating and chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenging Vengeance unto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self. <hi>Vengeance belongeth unto me, I will recompence, saith the Lord.</hi> Which Passage the <hi>Apostle</hi> cites out of <hi>Deuteronomy,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Deut. 32.35.</note>
               <hi>To me belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth Vengeance and Recompence, and the Lord shall judge his People.</hi> It is his great and royal Prerogative that he doth sometimes make use of in inflicting Judgments upon the Wicked in this World, but most especially in the World to come. And to this future Venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, the Words ought particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly to be applyed. Now from this consideration, That Venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance in a peculiar Manner be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:206211:109"/>unto the great God, we may observe,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That God himself will be the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Inflicter of the Punishments of the Damned.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is therefore here called a <hi>falling into the Hands of the living God,</hi> which denotes his immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate Efficiency in their Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
            <p>It is true, God doth use se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Instruments of Torture in Hell. There is the <hi>Worm that never dies,</hi> and <hi>the Fire that never goes out,</hi> which I suppose to be not only a <hi>Metaphorical,</hi> but pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly a <hi>Material Fire,</hi> elevated to such a degree of Subtilty, as that it shall at once torture the Soul, and not consume the Body. And this Fire the <hi>Devils,</hi> who are their Executioners, will be officiously raking about them, using all their malicious Art to
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:206211:110"/>increase their eternal Misery. But these things are but small Appendages, and the slighter Circumstances of their Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; the most exact and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerable part of their Torture shall be inflicted on them from another <hi>Fire,</hi> an intelligent E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlasting, and therefore an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quenchable Fire, even God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, for so he is said to be, <hi>Our God is a consuming Fire.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Heb. 12.19.</note>
            </p>
            <p>And though we ordinarily speak only of <hi>Hell Fire,</hi> yet not only <hi>Hell,</hi> but <hi>Heaven</hi> is full of this <hi>Fire,</hi> consult that place, <hi>Who among us shall dwell with the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring Fire?</hi>
               <note place="margin">Isa. 33.14.</note>
               <hi>who among us shall dwell with everlasting Burnings?</hi> Would not one think at the first sound of the Words, that the <hi>Prophet</hi> speaks only of such as should be damned in Hell, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining there in everlasting Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings?
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:206211:110"/>And demands of them, who among them could endure this? No, but it appears plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that this <hi>Fire</hi> and <hi>Burning</hi> is in Heaven it self, and the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet</hi> by putting this Question, <hi>Who shall dwell with the devou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Fire and everlasting Burnings?</hi> asks who shall be saved, and not who shall be destroyed? And therefore in the 15th. <hi>Verse,</hi> he tells us, that he shall do it, <hi>who walketh uprightly, and speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth uprightly, that despiseth the gain of Oppression, that shaketh his Hands from holding of Bribes, that stop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth his Ears from hearing of Blood, and shutteth his Eyes from seeing of Evil.</hi> Such a one shall dwell with the devouring Fire; that is, he shall for ever dwell with God in Heaven. So that we see God is a <hi>Fire</hi> both to the Wicked, and to the Godly; to the Wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:206211:111"/>he is a <hi>penetrating torturing Fire,</hi> and they are combustible Matter for his Wrath and Vengeance to prey upon; but to the Godly he is a <hi>purifying and cherishing Fire</hi> only. And as <hi>Lightning</hi> doth not only cleanse and refine the <hi>Air,</hi> but <hi>rends Trees</hi> and <hi>Rocks</hi> in pieces; dissolves <hi>Metals,</hi> and breaks thorow whatsoever oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth it: So this great and <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty Fire</hi> only refresheth and comforteth the Godly, whereas it breaks and tears the Wicked in pieces, and melts them like Wax before the scorching Heat of it. And though I deny not but there may be somewhat like that which we commonly apprehend when we speak of <hi>Hell,</hi> some unquenchable Flames pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared by the Wisdom and Power of God for the eternal Torment of those that shall be cast there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>into;
<pb facs="tcp:206211:111"/>

               <pb n="193" facs="tcp:206211:112"/>yet withal I think that their most exquisite Torments shall be from that <hi>Fire</hi> that is God himself.</p>
            <p>For if we observe, it is said to be <hi>everlasting Fire prepared for the Devil and his Angels.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Matth. 25.41.</note> Now the <hi>Devils</hi> are spiritual Substan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and flames of <hi>Fire</hi> themselves. <hi>He maketh his Angels Spirits,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psalm 104.4.</note>
               <hi>and his Ministers,</hi> that is his Ministring Spirits, whether good or evil, whether Ministers of his Wrath, or Ministers of his Mercy, <hi>He makes them Flames of Fire.</hi> They are such piercing and subtile Flames, that <hi>Lightning</hi> it self is but gross and dull, compared to them: Yet here is a <hi>Fire</hi> that shall even torture <hi>Fire</hi> it self, a <hi>Fire</hi> that shall burn those Flames of <hi>Fire;</hi> and that is God, who being a Spirit, and the God of Spirits, can easily pierce into the
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:206211:113"/>very Centre of their Being. So that the Damned in <hi>Hell</hi> shall for ever find themselves burnt with a <hi>double Fire,</hi> a <hi>Material Fire,</hi> suted and adapted to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press Pain and Torment upon the Body, yet without wasting and consuming it; And an <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visible intellectual Fire,</hi> that shall prey upon the Soul, and fill it with unspeakable Anguish and Horror, and this is no other than God himself.</p>
            <p>And in this there is a true Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel between <hi>Heaven</hi> and <hi>Hell;</hi> for as in <hi>Heaven,</hi> though there are many created Excellencies and Glories, which contribute to the <hi>Beatitude</hi> of the Saints; yet their most substantial Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness is from their immediate fruition of God: So likewise in <hi>Hell,</hi> though there be many created and invented <hi>Tortures,</hi>
               <pb n="195" facs="tcp:206211:113"/>yet the most intolerable Misery of the Damned, is from the immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate infliction and infusion of the Divine Wrath into them, which no Creature can convey to them in such a Manner and Measure as they there feel it; but God himself pours the full Vials of it into their Souls. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as the Saints are called <hi>Ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels of Mercy,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 9.22.</note> so the Wicked are called <hi>Vessels of Wrath, fitted for Destruction.</hi> Such Vessels into which God will pour in of his Vengeance, and fill brimm full with his wrath and fury for ever.</p>
            <p>The Apostle speaking of wicked Men, tells us,<note place="margin">1 Thes. 1.9.</note>
               <hi>They shall be punished with everlasting De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction from the Presence of the Lord, and from the Glory of his Power.</hi> Where we must not think that this Phrase <hi>[From the Presence of the Lord]</hi> denotes only
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:206211:114"/>that part of their Punishment which we call <hi>poena Damni,</hi> or the Punishment of Loss; but rather that it denotes the effici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Cause of their <hi>poena Sensus,</hi> or the punishment of Sense; not that their punishment shall only be, to be for ever banished from his Presence, but that this Presence shall be active in inflicting Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishments upon them, and we may read it thus, <hi>They shall be punished with everlasting Destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, by the Presence of the Lord, and by the Glory of his Power:</hi> For as God's glorious Power is effective of their Destruction, so also is his dread Presence of that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suming and tormenting Fire.</p>
            <p>And thus much briefly for the <hi>first</hi> Thing observable in the <hi>Text,</hi> namely God's appropria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Vengeance unto himself, <hi>Vengeance belongeth unto me,</hi> and
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:206211:114"/>it is a <hi>falling into the Hands of the Living God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I come now to the <hi>second</hi> Thing observable in the Words, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> the dreadfulness of this Venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance inferred, from the conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the Author and Infli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter of it; for because it is Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Vengeance, and a falling into the Hands of the Living God, therefore it must needs be verry terrible. And here I shall <hi>first</hi> take notice of those Expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions that my <hi>Text</hi> affords, to set forth the Terrour of this Wrath. And then consider o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Demonstrations of it. And here,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Consider that all other Vengeance is as nothing in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison of that which God takes on a damned Soul. You may possibly have heard of strange and horrid Revenges that some
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:206211:115"/>cruel Men have carved out unto themselves, putting those that have offended them to such Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures as were unfit for Men ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to inflict or suffer. <hi>Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi> abound with such <hi>Barbari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,</hi> I am loth to offend your Ears so much as to recount them, let us only take an estimate by the dreadful Revenge that <hi>David</hi> took on the <hi>Ammonites:</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Sam. 12. last.</note>
               <hi>He put them under Saws, and Harrows of Iron, and made them pass through the Brick-Kilns.</hi> And all this Severity, (if not to say Cruelty) was to revenge the insolent Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front done to his <hi>Embassadours.</hi> It is doubtless no small Torture to be burnt alive, for Fire is a search<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Thing, and eats deep into the Senses; but yet this kind of Death was a merciful dispatch in comparison of the others: Think what it is to be stretcht along,
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:206211:115"/>to have the sharp spikes of an Harrow tear up your Flesh, and draw out your Bowels and Bones after them: Or what it is to be sawn asunder, and to have those small Teeth eat their way slowly thorow you, while they jarr against your Bones, and pull out your Nerves and Sinews thread by thread. How many <hi>Deaths,</hi> think you, were these mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable Creatures compelled to suffer before they were permitted to die. Yet these, and all the witty Tortures that ever were invented by the greatest Masters of Cruelty, are nothing in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison of the Vengeance that God will take upon Sinners in <hi>Hell:</hi> And therefore he says, <hi>Vengeance is mine, I will recompence.</hi> As if he should say, Alas, all that you can do one to another signifies nothing, it is not to be
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:206211:116"/>accounted <hi>Vengeance,</hi> that is too great a Name for such poor Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects. It is a Prerogative that God challengeth to himself to be the <hi>Avenger:</hi> And whatever Creatures meddle with, if they have not a Commission from him, it is their Sin; and therefore pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Persons, whom he hath not invested with such Authority, ought not to take upon them to avenge their own Cause. Or if they have a Commission, yet all their execution of <hi>Vengeance</hi> is but feeble and weak. We find in <hi>Ecclesiastical History</hi> that the <hi>Holy Martyrs</hi> have often mock'd at all the <hi>cruel Tortures</hi> of their enraged <hi>Persecutors,</hi> and God hath either taken from them all sense of Pain, or else given them in such strong Consolations, that they have triumph'd in all the Extremity of them; O how
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:206211:116"/>have they hugg'd the <hi>Stake</hi> at which they were to be burnt, courted the <hi>Beasts</hi> that were to devour them, and been stretched upon the <hi>Rack</hi> with as much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, as they have stretch'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves upon their Beds; and not so much suffered, as enjoyed their Deaths! God hath so mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifully taken off the Edge and Keenness of their <hi>Torments,</hi> to shew that <hi>Vengeance</hi> is his Right, and that they are but contempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble things that one Man can in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict upon another, scarce worthy to be called <hi>Vengeance.</hi> And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, let it be never so sharp and cutting, yet it cannot be long durable; the more intolerable any <hi>Torments</hi> are, the sooner they work our escape from them. And though Malice may wish the Perpetuity of our Pain, yet it is not possible for mortal Men
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:206211:117"/>to prosecute an immortal Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge, the Death, either of them, or our selves, will put a period to our Sufferings. And what a small matter is it to undergo pain for a few days only, this is not worthy to be called <hi>Vengeance,</hi> nor is it like that which the great God will inflict, which is both insupportable and eternal. And therefore,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> The Apostle calls it <hi>a falling into the hands of the Living God.</hi> And this denotes to us the Perpetuity and Eternity of this <hi>Vengeance.</hi> God ever lives to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict it, and Sinners shall ever live to suffer it; for they fall into his Hands. God hath lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed out a Life to every wicked Man, he hath his Term of Years set him, wherein he lives to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, enjoying his Lusts, and the Pleasures and Profits of this
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:206211:117"/>present World; and all this while <hi>Vengeance</hi> intermedles little with him: but when his Life is expir'd, and his Years run out, he then falls into the Hands of the great Lord of all, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes the Possession of his <hi>Venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance</hi> and <hi>Justice</hi> for ever. And then, <hi>he is the Living God,</hi> and such wicked Wretches must for ever live to endure the most dreadful execution of his Power and Wrath. Were there any Term or Period set to their <hi>Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> should they when they have endured them thousands of thousands of Years, afterwards be annihilated, the expectation of this Release would give them some support; yea, it would be some solace to them in their Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings to think that at last they should be freed from them: But this is the <hi>Accent</hi> of their Misery,
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:206211:118"/>and that which makes them al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together desperate, that it is for ever; for ever they must lie and wallow in those Flames that shall never be quenched, and shall always be bit and stung with that <hi>Worm that shall never die,</hi> they are fallen into the <hi>Hands of the living God,</hi> who will never let them go as long as he lives, that is, never to all Eternity. He is a consuming <hi>Fire,</hi> but yet spends not any part of his Few<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el, he consumes without di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minishing them, and destroys, but still perpetuates their being. A wise and intelligent Fire, (as <hi>Minutius</hi> calls him) that devours the Damned, but still repairs them, and by tormenting still nourishes them for future Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. <hi>Sapiens ille ignis, urit &amp; reficit, carpit &amp; nutrit.</hi> And when they have lain burning in this
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:206211:118"/>
               <hi>Fire</hi> all Ages that <hi>Arithmetick</hi> can summ up, Millions of Thousands, and Thousands of Millions, yet still it is but the beginning of their Sorrows. O think with your selves how long and tedious a little time seems, when you are in pain, you complain then that Time hath leaden Feet, and wish the Days and Hours would roll away faster, and you never find them so slow-paced, as when they pass over a <hi>sick Bed.</hi> Oh then what will it be when you shall lie sweltring under the <hi>Wrath and Vengeance of the living God,</hi> the intolerableness of your Pain and Torment will make e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Day seem an Age; and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Year as long as Eternity, and yet you must lie there an Eternity of those long Years. Methinks this consideration of <hi>Eternal Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> should astonish the Heart,
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:206211:119"/>and sink the Spirits of wicked Wretches; for though they were not to be so excessively sharp as they are, yet the <hi>Eternity</hi> of them should make them altogether in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerable. There is no pain so small but it would make us des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate, were we assured it would never wear off, that we should never obtain any ease or freedom from it. Whatever Pain we suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, our encouragement unto Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience is, that shortly it will be over: But now in <hi>Hell</hi> there is no period sixt to their <hi>Torments,</hi> they are all eternal, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore whatsoever they are for the Measure of them, yet are they utterly intolerable for their Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration and Continuance. Couldst thou shove away Millions of Years with a Wish, yet all this would avail nothing; for there are as many Years in Eternity as
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:206211:119"/>there are Moments, and as many Millions of Years as there are Years; that is, it is an infinite boundless Duration, and when thou hast struck thy Thoughts as deep into it as thou canst, yet thou art but at the top of the Heap, and it is still a whole Eternity to the bottom.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Consider also that the <hi>Wrath</hi> and <hi>Vengeance</hi> of God is most dreadful, not only from the Eternal Duration thereof; but also from the excessive An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish and Smart of those <hi>Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> that he inflicts; nothing that we have felt, or can feel in this present Life, can come into any comparison with them; and therefore the <hi>Text</hi> calls it, <hi>A fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling into the Hands of God.</hi> Here on Earth God's Hand doth some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times fall upon us, and it falls very heavy too; and lays upon
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:206211:120"/>us sore and weighty Burthens; but these are nothing to our fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling into the Hands of God. There is as much difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween his Wrath and Displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure falling upon us, and our falling upon it, as there is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween our having a few drops of a Showre falling upon us, and our falling into a River, or into the Sea, and being overwhelmed with the great Waters thereof; and yet how dreadful is it when God's Hand only falls upon us! It was a sad Complaint of the <hi>Psalmist,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psal. 32.4.</note>
               <hi>That God's Hand lay heavy upon him.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psal. 38.2.</note> And <hi>That God's Hand prest him sore.</hi> Grievous Burthens and sore Pressures may be laid upon us by this Hand of God, and that both as to out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Afflictions, and inward Troubles.</p>
            <pb n="209" facs="tcp:206211:120"/>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> As to outward Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. How dreadfully doth God stretch out his Hand against some, making wide and terrible Breaches upon them; Some in their Estates, some in their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, and some in their bodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Health and Strength. Have you never been about the sick Beds of those that have roared through extremity of Pain, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Limb being upon the Rack, and God filling them with a Complication of loathsom, tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting and incurable Diseases? and yet all this is but only a fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of God's Hand upon them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> As to inward Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles: We see how God cramps some Mens Consciences, breathes Fire and Flames into their very Souls, and makes deep Wounds in their Spirits, forcing them tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row the extremity of Anguish
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:206211:121"/>to cry out, <hi>they are damn'd, they are damn'd;</hi> yea some have even wisht that they were in Hell, supposing those everlasting Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments would not be more unsuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferable than what they here felt. And indeed these inward Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles are far more grievous than any outward can be. We hear <hi>Heman</hi> crying out, that <hi>because of these Terrours of the Lord, he was ready to die from his Youth up. And whilst <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 word">

               </gap>se Patience is celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for bearing all his outward Asslictions, loss of Estate, of Children, of Health, with an heroick Constancy, (<hi>You have heard,</hi> says St. <hi>James of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience of</hi> Job) yet when God comes to touch his Spirit with his Wrath, then we hear of his Impatience, he <hi>curseth the Day of
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:206211:121"/>his Birth, and wishes that God would destroy him, that he would let loose his Hand and cut him off.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Job 6.9.</note> And wherefore are these passio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Requests? why, he tells us, <hi>The Arrows of the Almighty are within me, the Poison whereof drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth up my Spirit: The Terrors of God do set themselves in array against me.</hi> And therefore though he could patiently bear all that the rage of the Devil could do a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him, when he toucht his Wealth, his Children; yea, when he toucht his Body: yet his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience could no longer hold out, when God came to touch his Soul and Conscience.</p>
            <p>And yet the greatest Terrors of Conscience, whether in the Children of God to their Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, or in the Wicked to their Desperation, are but light and small touches of his Hand
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:206211:122"/>in comparison with what shall be exprest hereafter on the Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in <hi>Hell.</hi> For,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> To the Godly these Afflictions are mixed with Love and Mercy. They come not as <hi>Plagues,</hi> but as <hi>Medicaments</hi> to do them good. But in <hi>Hell</hi> all is Wrath, pure Wrath and Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment without Mercy. And cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly if those Sufferings which are inflicted in Love, and allay'd with Mercy, are yet so very dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to the People of God; how dreadfull will the Wrath of God be in <hi>Hell,</hi> where it shall be pure and unmixed, and nothing put into that Cup which the Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned are there to drink of, but the rankest Venome that can be squeezed out of all the <hi>Curses</hi> that eyer God hath denounced? And then,</p>
            <pb n="213" facs="tcp:206211:122"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> To the Wicked all the Sufferings they here endure are nothing in comparison with what they must eternally suffer in <hi>Hell.</hi> They are now only sprinkled with a few drops of God's Wrath, but in <hi>Hell</hi> all his Waves shall go over them for ever. Here they do but sip a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of that Cup, and taste a little of the Froth of it, and should they drink deeper, Earth could not hold them, but they would grow drunk, and reel and stag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger into <hi>Hell;</hi> but there they must for ever drink the very Dregs of that Cup of Trembling and Astonishment. And thou who now roarest like a wild Bull in a Net, when God's Hand is only upon thee, what wilt thou do when thou shalt eternally fall under his Mighty Hands? Thou now cryest out of the Intolerable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:206211:123"/>of thy present Pain: but, alas, hadst thou but felt one gripe of the Torments of the Damned in <hi>Hell;</hi> had God and the Devil had but one blow a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piece at thee, thou wouldst choose to live for ever here on Earth in the most exquisite Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture that could be devised, the sharpest <hi>Paroxysms</hi> of the <hi>Stone</hi> or <hi>Gout,</hi> to be stretcht upon the Rack, to lye broke upon the Wheel, to have thy Flesh pluckt by fiery Pincers; thou wouldst choose to suffer all these to Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity; yea and chose them as Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creations and Divertisements, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than return to that place of Torment; where not only the Eternity, but the Anguish of them, is infinite and unconceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able. And as one Day in the <hi>Joys of Heaven</hi> is better than a thousand Years in all the impure
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:206211:123"/>and low Delights of Earth: So one Day in the <hi>Torments of Hell,</hi> is far worse than a thousand in the sharpest Miseries we can in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure in this Life.</p>
            <p>Here our Pains usually are but partial, God aimes and shoots with his Arrow but at some one part of us: If he wounds our Spirits, yet this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visible Shaft (like <hi>Lightning</hi>) passeth thorow without making a Breach in our Bodies, or E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>states; we have still our Health and Plenty left us. Or if he strike the Body, usually it is but in one, or at most but in some few Places, and we enjoy ease in the rest: But in <hi>Hell,</hi> God doth as it were wrap the whole Man up in Searcloth, and set it on fire round about them, so that they are tormented in every part, neither <hi>Soul</hi> nor <hi>Body</hi> es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caping,
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:206211:124"/>nor any Power or Faculty of the one, nor any Part or Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the other.</p>
            <p>When we fall into the Hands of God, we are plunged into an Ocean of Wrath, and are covered all over with his Indignation; the Understanding, Will, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, Affections, are all as full of Torments as they can hold: For what can be greater Anguish to the Mind than to know our Misery, and to know it to be remediless? And what can be greater Anguish to the Will and Affections, than most ardently and vehemently to desire freedom from those <hi>Torments,</hi> but yet to despair of ever obtaining it? And what can fill the Conscience with greater Anguish, than to reflect with infinite Horrour and Regret, that it was the Sinners own Folly and Madness that brought
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:206211:124"/>them to this miserable Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? How will they be ready to rend and tear themselves in pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, their Consciences curse their Wills, and their Wills curse their Affections, and their Affections the Objects that enticed them to the commission of those Sins, the Revenges of which they must now eternally suffer? And as for the <hi>Bodies</hi> of these Damned Souls, they shall after the <hi>Resurrection</hi> and dreadful <hi>Day of Judgment,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come all Fire, like a live Coal, Fire shall be imbibed into the very Substance of them, and they not have so much <hi>as a drop of Water afforded them to cool the tip of their Tongues.</hi>

<pb n="218" facs="tcp:206211:125"/>and Ulcer. And this is a third Consideration of the dreadfulness of everlasting Vengeance; <hi>It is a falling into God's Hands.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Consider, it is <hi>a falling into the Hands of the Living God himself,</hi> and not of any Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.<note place="margin">2 Sam. 24.14.</note> Indeed we read, <hi>David</hi> chose rather <hi>to fall into the Hands of the Lord, than into the Hands of Men.</hi> It is true, when there is Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, and hopes of obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Mercy, this is far more eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible: for the Chastisements of the Lord are full of Mercy; but the tender Mercies of the wicked are cruel. But where all hopes of Mercy are excluded, as they are in Hell, certainly there it is infinitely more dreadful to fall into the Hands of a Sin-reven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging-God, than into the Hands of all the Creatures in Heaven, Earth, or Hell it self. One
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:206211:125"/>would have thought it had been terrible enough, if the Apostle had said, It is a fearful thing to fall into the Hands of <hi>Devils;</hi> and so indeed it were, if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider either their Power, or their Malice: they can easily find out such tormenting Ingredients, and apply them to such tender Parts, that it would transcend the Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of any Man, quietly to bear but what one <hi>Devil</hi> can inflict. Do we not often see in the Illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions of black and sooty <hi>Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly,</hi> what strange Fears and Terrors they can imprint upon the Fancy, what Horror and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spair they can work in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, so as to make Men wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of their Lives, and many times perswade them to destroy them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, only to know the worst of what they must suffer? And all this he can do out of his own
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:206211:126"/>Kingdom; what then can he do when he hath got Sinners into his own Dominions? What ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act Tortures can he inflict up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them there? such indeed as we cannot tell what they are, and may it please God we never may.</p>
            <p>And yet the <hi>Devil</hi> is but a fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-Creature; but wicked Men are to fall into the Hands, not of a Creature, but of the great Creatour, into the Hands of God himself, whose Power is infinitely beyond the Devil's, so that he is the Tormentor even of them.</p>
            <p>Think then with thy self, <hi>O Sinner,</hi> that if God scourges, and torments the very Devils, who yet do so insufferably tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the Damned; how infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely intolerable then is that Wrath which God himself shall inflict upon them? Consider
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:206211:126"/>with thy self, if thou canst not bear those Pains and Torments which the <hi>Devils</hi> inflict, and if the <hi>Devils</hi> cannot bear those Pains and Torments which God in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicts upon them; how wilt thou then, O Sinner, be able to bear the immediate Wrath and Vengeance of the great God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self?</p>
            <p>Nay, let me go yet much lower; and suppose that God should make use of common and ordinary Creatures for the punishment of wicked Men, who is there that could bear this? If God should only keep a Man living for ever in the midst of a Furnace of gross and earthly Fire, how dreadful would this be! If but a Spark of Fire fall upon any part of the Body, what an acute <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>in will it cause? much more <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> thy whole Man should
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:206211:127"/>be all over on a light Flame, and thou for ever kept alive to feel the piercing Torment of it. And yet what is our dull unactive Fire in comparison of that pure in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligent Fire, which shall melt down the Damned like Wax, and lick up the very Spirits of their Souls? Or suppose God who knows the several Stings that are in all his Creatures, should take out of them the most sharp Ingredients, and from them all make up a tormen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Composition; if he should take Poison and Venome out of one, and Fire and Scorching out of another, and Smart and Sting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of a third, and the Quintessence of Bitterness out of a fourth; and by his infinite Skill, heighten all these to a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternatural Acrimony; and should apply this Composition thus fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:206211:127"/>mixed and blended toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, unto any of us, what an intolerable Anguish would it cause? And if Creatures can cause such Tortures, what a dreadfull thing then is it to fall into the Hands of God himself? For when God conveys his Wrath to us by Creatures, it must needs lose infinitely in the Conveyance. When God takes up one Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to strike another, it is as if a <hi>Gyant</hi> should take up a <hi>Straw</hi> to strike a Man; for though he be never so strong, yet the Blow can be but weak, because of the weakness of the Instrument; and yet alas how terrible are such weak Blows to us? What will it then be when God shall im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately crush us by the unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated strokes of his own Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Arm, and express the Power of his Wrath, and the Glory of
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:206211:128"/>his Justice and Severity in our e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Destruction? And this is the <hi>fourth Demonstration</hi> of the dreadfulness of Divine Venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> Consider that the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle calls this Wrath, which the living God will inflict upon Sinners, by the Name of <hi>Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance.

            <p>And <hi>Secondly,</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> God is an <hi>Aven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger</hi> as well as a <hi>Judge.</hi> He is a Party concerned, as having been wronged, and injured by their Sins. And in relation to this, the Punishments that God will inflict upon them, are called Wrath and Fury, smoaking An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and Jealousie:<note place="margin">Deut. 29.20.</note>
               <hi>The Anger of the Lord and his Jealousie shall smoak against that Man.</hi> Also, Fiery Indignation,<note place="margin">Heb. 10.27.</note> all which we find amass'd and heaped together,<note place="margin">Zeph. 3.8.</note>
               <hi>My Determination</hi> (saith God) <hi>is
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:206211:130"/>to gather the Nations, to pour upon them mine Indignation, even all my fierce Anger; for all the Earth shall be devoured with the Fire of my Jealousie.</hi> Now, all these Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions signifie the terribleness of that <hi>Vengeance</hi> which God will take. For when the Wrath of Man only stirs him up to revenge an Injury, he will be sure to do it to the utmost extremity of all his Power. And if the <hi>Revenge</hi> of a poor weak Man be so dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful a thing; how insupportable will be the <hi>Vengeance</hi> of the great God, who assumes it to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self as part of his Royalty? <hi>Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance is mine.</hi> See that terrible place,<note place="margin">Nah. 1.2.</note>
               <hi>God is jealous, and the Lord revengeth: the Lord revengeth, and is furious, the Lord will take Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance on his Adversaries, and he reserveth Wrath for his Enemies.</hi> God reserveth Wrath for Sinners,
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:206211:130"/>and keeps it in store, even that Wrath which themselves have treasured up against the Day of Wrath.</p>
            <p>Now this <hi>Revenging-Wrath</hi> of God hath Two things in it that justly make it dreadful.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> In that, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
               <hi>Revenge</hi> always aims at Satisfaction, and seeks to repair Injuries received, by inflicting Punishment on the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fender. This gives ease to the Party grieved; and if this <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge</hi> be commensurate to the greatness of the Offence, he rests satisfied in it. And therefore, God speaking of himself accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Passions and Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Men, solaces himself in the thoughts of that <hi>Vengeance</hi> he would take upon Sinners,<note place="margin">Isa. 1.24.</note>
               <hi>Ah I will ease me of mine Adversaries, I will avenge me of mine Enemies.</hi> And, O how dreadful that <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge</hi>
               <pb n="228" facs="tcp:206211:131"/>must be, that shall ease the Heart of God, and give him satisfaction, for the heinous Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocations that Sinners have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted against him. For consider,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> How great and manifold our Offences have been, and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry act of Sin, yea the least that ever we committed, is an infinite Debt, and carries in it an infinite Guilt, because committed against an infinite Majesty. For all Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences take their Measures, not only from the Matter of the Act, but from the Person against whom they are committed: As a reviling injurious Word against our <hi>Equals,</hi> will but bear an Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on at Law; but against the <hi>Prince,</hi> it is High-Treason, and punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able with Death. So here, the least Offence against the infinite Majesty of God, becomes it self infinite: The Guilt of it is far
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:206211:131"/>beyond whatsoever we can pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly conceive: and yet what in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite Numbers of these infinite Sins have we committed? The <hi>Psalmist</hi> tells us,<note place="margin">Psal. 40.12.</note>
               <hi>They are more than the Hairs of our Head.</hi> Yea, we may well take in all the Sands of the Sea-shore to cast them up by. Our Thoughts are incessantly in Motion; they keep pace with the Moments, and are continually twinkling, and yet, <hi>Every Imagination of the Thoughts of our Hearts is evil.</hi> What Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes of them have been grosly wicked and impious; Atheisti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, Blasphemous, Unclean, Worldly, and Malicious! and the best of them have been very defective, and far short of that Spirituality and Heavenliness that ought to give a Tincture unto them. And besides the Sins of our Thoughts, how deep
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:206211:132"/>have our <hi>Tongues</hi> set us on the score? We have talk'd our selves in debt to the Justice of God, and with our own Breath have been blowing up everlasting and unquenchable Fire. And add to these the numberless crowd and sum of our sinful Actions, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in we have busily imployed our selves to provoke the Holy and Jealous God to Wrath, and we shall find our Sins to be doubly infinite in their own particular Guilt and Demerit. And now, <hi>O Sinner,</hi> when an angry and fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious God shall come to exact from thee a full satisfaction for all these Injuries, a Satisfaction in which he may eternally rest and acquiesce, such as may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair and recompence his wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Honour, think sadly with thy self, how infinitely dreadful this must needs be. Assure thy self God
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:206211:132"/>will not lose by thee, but will fetch his Glory out of thee, and take such a <hi>Revenge</hi> upon thee as shall as much please and content him, as his infinite Mercy doth in those whom he saves. And how great then must this <hi>Venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance</hi> be?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Consider how dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful a Revenge God took on his own dear Son, our Lord Jesus Christ, when he came to satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie his Justice upon him for our Sins. His Wrath fell infinitely heavy upon him, and the pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of it was so intollerable, that it squeezed out drops of clotted Blood from him in the <hi>Garden,</hi> and that sad Cry on the Cross, <hi>My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?</hi> And yet,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Our Lord Christ was supported under all his Sufferings by the ineffable Union of the
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:206211:133"/>
               <hi>Deity.</hi> He had infinite Power for him, as well as against him; infinite Power to bear him up, as well as to crush him. In Christ's Sufferings, the Power of God seem'd as it were to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter with, and run contrary to it self in the same Channel. And as he had the support of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite Power in his Sufferings, so likewise had he in the greatest of his Agonies the Ministry of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels</hi> to comfort him, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fresh the Droopings and Fain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of his Humane Nature. And,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> The infinite Digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Christ's Person, being God as well as Man, might well compound for the Rigour of his Punishments, and stamp such a Value upon his Humiliation, that less degrees of Suffering from him, might be fully satisfactory.
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:206211:133"/>For indeed it cannot be but an infinite Punishment, for an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite Person to be punished. But thou that art but a vile contempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Creature, made up of Mud and Slime, hast nothing in thy Nature wherewith to satisfie the Justice of God, but only the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Destruction and Perdition of it. Thou hast no Worth nor Dignity, the consideration where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of might perswade the Almighty to mitigate the least of his Wrath towards thee: And when it falls in all its weight and force upon thee, thou hast nothing to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port thee. It is true, the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty Power of God shall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue thee in thy Being, but thou wilt for ever curse and blaspheme that Support, that shall be given thee only to perpetuate thy Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and ten thousand times wish that God would destroy
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:206211:134"/>thee once for all, and that thou mightest for ever shrink away in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to nothing: but that will not be granted thee; no, thou shalt not have so much as the comfort of dying, nor escape the Venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of God by Annihilation: but his Power will for ever so support thee, as for ever to tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment thee, which is only such a Support as a Man on the <hi>Rack</hi> or on the <hi>Wheel,</hi> supported so as they cannot come off, the Engine of their Torture upholds them. And as for any help or relief the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry of Angels will afford thee, think what solace it will bring thee, when God shall set on whole Legions of <hi>infernal Ghosts,</hi> black and hideous Spirits, as the Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutioners of his Wrath, who shall for ever triumph in thy Woes and add to them, hurl Fire-brands at thee, heap Fewel
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:206211:134"/>about thee, and fully satiate their Malice upon thee, as God satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies his Justice. And this is one <hi>Consideration</hi> of the dreadfulness of this Vengeance, in that it aims at and exacts satisfaction for Sin, which will be infinitely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerable, because our Sins are infinite both in Number and Heinousness. And because Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ, who was to satisfie not for his own, but for the Sins of others, though he were up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held by the <hi>Divine Nature,</hi> and possibly underwent not such A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crimony of Wrath as the Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned do; yet his Sufferings were unspeakable and unknown Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows: And how much sorer then shall wicked Men bear for their own Sins, when Justice shall come to reckon with them, and to exact from them to the very utmost Farthing, of all that they owe?</p>
            <pb n="236" facs="tcp:206211:135"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Consider that <hi>Reven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging Wrath</hi> stirs up all that is in God against a Sinner. <hi>Wrath</hi> when it is whet and set on by <hi>Revenge,</hi> redoubles a Man's Force, and makes him perform Things that he could not do in his cold Blood, it fires all a Man's Spirits, and calls them forth to express their utmost Efforts. So this <hi>Revenging Wrath</hi> of God draws forth all the Force and Activity of his Attributes, and sets them against a Sinner, and how dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful then must that Execution needs be? We see what great Works God can perform when he is not stirred up thereunto by his Wrath and Indignation. He speaks a whole World into Being, and speaks it with a cold and calm Breath. Certainly it was no small piece of work, to spread out the Heavens, and lay the
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:206211:135"/>Foundations of the Earth, and to work all those Wonders of <hi>Creation</hi> and <hi>Providence</hi> which we daily behold; but yet all these Things God did, (if I may so speak) without any Emotion. But when he comes to take <hi>Venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance</hi> upon Sinners, he is then in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed, all that is in God, is as it were on fire. <hi>Jealousie,</hi> says <hi>Solomon, is the Rage of a Man.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Prov. 6.34.</note> Now when God's Jealousie shall be stirred in him, think how im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuously it will break forth in the fearful effects of it. <hi>The Lord shall stir up Jealousie like a Man of War; he shall cry, yea, roar,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Isa. 42.13.</note>
               <hi>he shall prevail against his Enemies.</hi> If the calm and sedate Works of God are so great and wonderful, how great then will his <hi>Vengeance</hi> be, when Anger, Fury, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation shall excite and whet his Power to shew the very ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:206211:136"/>most of what it can do? And therefore we find that though God had inflicted dreadful Plagues upon the <hi>Israelites</hi> in the Wilderness, and had shewn mighty effects of his Power and Vengeance, yet we find the <hi>Church</hi> blesseth him,<note place="margin">Psal. 78.38.</note>
               <hi>That he turned away his Anger, and did not stir up all his Wrath.</hi> But in <hi>Hell</hi> God stirs up all his Wrath, every thing is set and bent against the Damned: And as to the <hi>Saints</hi> in Heaven, every Attribute of God concurs to make him merciful and graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to them. So to the Wicked in <hi>Hell,</hi> all the Perfections of God conspire either to stir up and kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle his Wrath, or else to assist him in the execution of it upon them. The infinite <hi>Wisdom</hi> of God contrives their Punishments, and which way to lay them on, of that they shall be most sharp
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:206211:136"/>and poinant. The <hi>Power</hi> of God that rouses it self against them, and proffers all its Succours and Assistance unto <hi>Vengeance.</hi> The <hi>Eternity</hi> and <hi>Unchangeableness</hi> of God come in as a dreadful Addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and makes that Wrath which of it self is insupportable, to be also everlasting? Yea that sweet and mild Attribute of God, his <hi>Mercy,</hi> the only Refuge and the only comfort of miserable Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, yet even this turns against them too, and because they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spised it when it shone forth in Patience and Forbearance, will not now regard them when they stand in need of its Rescue and Deliverance: So that all that is in God, arms it self to take <hi>Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance</hi> on Sinners: And O think how sore and fearful that Venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance will be, when God shall put forth all that is in himself for
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:206211:137"/>the executing of his Wrath up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on impenitent Sinners! And thus I have done with the <hi>Demonstrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> of the Dreadfulness of God's Wrath taken from the Words in the Text, <hi>Vengeance is mine, I will recompence it. 'Tis a fearful thing to fall into the Hands of the Living God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let us now consider some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Demonstrations</hi> of the Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of this Wrath. And,</p>

               <hi>First,</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> It appears to be excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding dreadful in that it is set forth to us in <hi>Scripture</hi> by all those things which are most terrible to Humane Nature.

               <note place="margin">1 Tim. 6.9.</note> One would think that to be drowned, might signifie Death enough of it self; but to be drowned in Perdition and Destruction, signifies moreover the fatalness and the depth of that Death into which they are plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged.

               <note place="margin">Mat. 22.13.</note>
               <hi>A being thrown into a Furnace of Fire,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mat. 13.42, 50</note> to be burnt alive. It is called,<note place="margin">Revel. 20.15.</note>
               <hi>a Lake of Fire,</hi> into which wicked Men shall be plunged all over, where they shall lye wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing and rowling among Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions of damned Spirits, in those infernal Flames.

               <note place="margin">Revel. 19 20.</note> And this Fire and Brimstone is that

               <note place="margin">Mat. 25.41.</note> And now we are arrived at the highest pitch of what Sence can feel, or Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination conceive. Or if it be possible that in your deepest Thoughts you can conceive any thing more dreadful than this, you may call it a <hi>Sea of molten Brimstone,</hi> set all on fire, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually spewing out sooty dark Flames, wherein endless Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes of sinful Wretches must lye tumbling to all Eternity, burnt up with the fierceness of a tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting and devouring Fire, scourged with Scorpions, stung with fiery Serpents, howling and roaring incessantly, and none to pity, much less to relieve and help
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:206211:140"/>them, grinding and gnashing their Teeth through the extremity of their Anguish and Torture. If now you can fancy any thingmore terrible and dreadful than this, <hi>Hell</hi> is that, yea and much more: For these things are <hi>Metaphorical;</hi> and though I cannot deny but some of these may be properly and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terally true, yet the literal Sense of these <hi>Metaphors</hi> do but faintly and weakly shew us what the least part of those everlasting Torments are.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Another <hi>Demonstrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> of the dreadfulness of this Vengeance is this, That it is a Wrath that shall come up unto, and equal all our Fears. You know what an inventive and inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious thing Fear is, what horrid Shapes it can fancy to it self out of every thing: Put but an active Fancy into an Affright, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:206211:140"/>the whole World will be filled with strange Monsters and hideous Apparitions. The very shaking of a Leaf will sometimes rout all the Forces and Resoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Men: And usually it is this wild Passion that doth en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hance all other Dangers, and make them seem greater and more dreadful than indeed they are. But now here it is impossible for a wicked Man to fear more than he shall certainly suffer. Let his Imaginations be hung round with all the dismal Shapes that ever frighted Men out of their Wits: let his Fancy dip its Pencil in the deepest Melancholy that ever a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Soul was besmeered with, and then strive to pourtray and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press the most terrible things that it can judge to be the <hi>Objects</hi> of Fear, or the Instruments of <hi>Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;</hi> yet the Wrath of the great
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:206211:141"/>God vastly exceeds all that Fear it self can possibly represent. See that strange Expression,<note place="margin">Psal. 90.11.</note>
               <hi>Who knows the Power of thine Anger? according to thy Fear, so is thy Wrath.</hi> That is, according to the fear Men have of thee, as dreadful and as terrible as they can possibly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend thy <hi>Wrath</hi> to be, so it is, and much more. Let the Heart of Man stretch it self to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most Bounds of Imagination, and call in to its Aid all the things that ever it hath heard or seen to be dreadful; let it (as that Pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, who to make a beautiful Piece, borrowed several of the best Features from several beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful Persons) borrow all the dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, all the direful Representati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that ever it met with, to make up one most terrible <hi>Idea;</hi> yet the Wrath of God shall still exceed it: He can execute more
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:206211:141"/>Wrath upon us than we can fear. Some wicked Men in this Life have had a Spark of this Wrath of God fall upon their Conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, when they lye roaring out under Despair and fearful Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctations of the fiery Indignation of God to consume and devour them. But alas this is nothing to what they shall hereafter feel. God now doth but open to them a small chink and crevice into <hi>Hell,</hi> he now doth but suffer a few small drops of his Wrath to fall upon them. And if this be so sore and smart that their Fears could never think of any thing more dreadful than what they now suffer: O what will it be then when he shall overwhelm them with a whole Deluge of his Wrath, and cause all his Waves to go over them? <hi>Fear him,</hi> says our Saviour, <hi>who is able to destroy
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:206211:142"/>both Soul and Body in Hell; yea, I say unto you,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mat. 10.28.</note>
               <hi>fear him.</hi> And yet when we have feared according to the utmost extent of our nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row Hearts, yet still his infinite Power and Wrath is infinitely more fearful than we can fear it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Consider the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal and immediate Subject of this Wrath of God, and that is the <hi>Soul,</hi> and this adds much to the dreadfulness of it. The acutest Torments that the <hi>Body</hi> is capable of, are but dull and flat things in comparison of what the <hi>Soul</hi> can feel. Now when God shall immediately with his own Hand lash the Soul, that refined and spiritual Part of Man, the Principle of all Life and Sensati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and shall draw Blood from it every Stripe, how intolerable may we conceive those Pains and Tortures to be? To shoot poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son'd
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:206211:142"/>Darts into a Man's Marrow, to rip up his Bowels with a Sword red hot; all this is as no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to it. Think what it is to have a drop of scalding Oyl, or melted Lead, fall upon the Apple of your Eyes, that should make them boyl and burn till they fall out of your Heads; such Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, nay infinitely more than such, is it to have the burning Wrath of God to fall upon the Soul. We find that Spirits which are infinitely inferiour unto God, can make strange Impressions up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Souls of Men: and shall not the great God much more, who is the Father of Spirits? Yes, he can torture them by his essential Wrath. And that God, who, as the Prophet <hi>Nahum</hi> speaks,<note place="margin">Nahum 1.6.</note>
               <hi>can melt Mountains, and make Hills and Rocks flow down at his Presence,</hi> can melt the Souls of the Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:206211:143"/>like lumps of Wax; for in his Displeasure he doth some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times do it to the best of Men even in this Life,<note place="margin">Psal. 22.14.</note>
               <hi>My Heart is melted like Wax in the midst of my Bowels:</hi> says <hi>David.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> The Dreadfulness of this Wrath of God may be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrated by this, That the Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment of the Damned is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served by God as his last Work. It is a Work which he will set himself about when all the rest of his Works are done, when he hath folded up the World, and laid it aside as a Thing of no further use, then will God set himself to this great Work, and pour out all the Treasures of his Wrath upon damned Wretches, as if God would so wholly mind this Business that he would lay all other Affairs aside, that he might be intent only upon this,
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:206211:143"/>having no other thing to interrupt him. Think then how full of Dread and Terror this must needs be, when God will as it were em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy all his <hi>Eternity</hi> about this, and have no other thing to take him off from doing it with all his Might. God hath reserved two Works, and but two for the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther World; One is the <hi>Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Elect,</hi> and the other is the <hi>Damnation of Reprobates.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now it is remarkable that God's last Works do always ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed his former: And therefore we find in the <hi>Creation</hi> of the World, God still proceeded on from more imperfect kind of Creatures to those that were more perfect, until he had fully built and finished, yea carved, and as it were painted this great House of the Universe; and then he brings Man into it as his last
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:206211:144"/>Work, as the Crown and Perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the rest: So God likewise acted in the manner of <hi>revealing his Will</hi> unto Mankind, first he spake to them by <hi>Dreams</hi> and <hi>Visions,</hi> but in the last Days (as the <hi>Apostle</hi> expresseth it) <hi>he hath spoken unto us by his Son.</hi> So also in the Dispensation of the Covenant of Grace, and Exhibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>Messiah,</hi> first he was made known only by <hi>Promise</hi> to the Fathers, then in <hi>Types</hi> and obscure Resemblances to the <hi>Jews,</hi> but in the latter Days, himself came and took upon him the form of a Servant, and wrought out a compleat <hi>Redemption</hi> for us. So usually the last Works of God are more compleat, perfect and excellent than the former. Now God's Punishing-Work is his last Work, and therefore it shall ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed in Greatness all that ever
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:206211:144"/>went before it. In his first Work, the Creation of the World, he demonstrated his infinite Power, Wisdom, and Godhead; but in the Destruction of Sinners, which is his last Work, he will mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest more of Power and Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, than he did in his creating them; and how fearful a Destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction then must this needs be? God hath variety of Works that he is carrying on in this World, and if his Glory doth not perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctly appear in one, he may ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest it in another. But when he shall confine himself only to two, as he will in the World to come, the saving of the Godly, and the damning of the Wicked, and this without any variety or change, certainly then these shall be performed to the very utmost of what God can do: for as he will save the Saints to the very
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:206211:145"/>utmost; so likewise will he damn and destroy Sinners to the very utmost.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> Another Demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the dreadfulness of this Wrath shall be drawn from this Consideration, That God will for ever inflict it for the glorify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his Power on the Damned. <hi>What if God willing to shew his Wrath,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 9.22.</note>
               <hi>and make his Power known:</hi> And <hi>they shall be punish'd with e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlasting Destruction from the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of the Lord,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Thes. 1.9.</note>
               <hi>and from the Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of his Power.</hi> Now certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, if God will inflict eternal Punishments upon them to shew forth his Power, their Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments must needs be infinitely great. For,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> All those Works where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in God shews forth his Power, are great and stupendous. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider what Power it was for God
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:206211:145"/>to lay the Beams of the World, and to erect so stately a Fabrick as Heaven and Earth. The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle therefore tells us, That <hi>by the Creation of the World, is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood the eternal Power of God.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 1.20.</note> When God shewed his Power in creating, O what a great and stupendous Work did he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce! And therefore certainly when God shall likewise shew his Power in destroying, the Punishments he will inflict will be wonderful and stupendous.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Consider God can easily destroy a Creature without shewing any great Power, or putting forth his Almighty Arm and Strength to do it. If he only withdraw his Power by which he upholds all things in their Beings, we should quickly fall all abroad into nothing: So easie is it for God to destroy the
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:206211:146"/>well-being of all his Creatures. But now if God will express the greatness and infiniteness of his Power in destroying Sinners, whom yet he can destroy without putting forth his Power, yea on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by withdrawing and withhol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding it; O how fearful must this Destruction needs be! A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las we are crusht before the Moth, and must needs perish, if God doth but suspend the Influence of his Power from us. How dreadfully then will he destroy, when he shall lay forth his infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite Power to do it, who can ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily do it without Power?</p>
            <p>And thus I have laid down some <hi>Demonstrations</hi> of the dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness of the Wrath and Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance of God, five of them drawn from the Words of the <hi>Text,</hi> and five drawn from other Considerations. I shall now shut
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:206211:146"/>up with two or three Words of Application.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi>
               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Use. </seg>1</label> Then be perswaded to believe that there is such a dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Wrath to come. I know well, you all profess that you do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that as there are uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivable Rewards of Glory re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served in <hi>Heaven</hi> for the Saints; so, that there are inexhaustible Treasures of Wrath reserved and laid up in <hi>Hell</hi> for all ungodly and impenitent Sinners. But ☉ how few are there that do re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally and cordially believe these things: Mens own Lives may be evident Convictions to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves of their Atheism and Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity: For the true reason of all that dissoluteness which we see abroad in the World proceeds much from hence, because Men are not perswaded that these dreadful Terrors of the Lord
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:206211:147"/>which have now been set before us, are any thing but an honest Artifice. They look upon them as things only invented to scare the World into good order, and to awe Men into some compass of Civility and Honesty: They think all those tremendous Threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings that God hath denounced in his Law to be things intended rather to fright Men, than to do execution upon them. And whereas one of the most effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Motives to Piety and an holy Life, is to be perswaded of the Terrors of the Lord, these are not yet perswaded that there are any such Terrors: But assure your selves these are not the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant Dreams of <hi>Melancholy Fancies,</hi> nor the Politick Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stures of Men that design to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muse the World with frightful Stories; but they are sad and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:206211:147"/>Truths, such as however you may now slight and contemn, yet shall you be wofully convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced of by your own experience, when after a few years, or possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly a few days, you shall be sunk down into that Place of Torment, that Gulph and Abyss of Misery, where the great God shall for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver express the Art, and the Power of his Vengeance in your everlasting Destruction.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi>
               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Use. </seg>2</label> This speaks abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of comfort to all those whose Sins are pardon'd, and they delivered from the Wrath to come. Look what Spring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tydes of Joy would rise in the Heart of a poor condemned <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lefactor,</hi> who every moment ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects the stroke of Justice to cut him off, to have a Pardon inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose and rescue him from Death. Such, yea far greater should be
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:206211:148"/>thy Joy who art freed meerly by a gracious Pardon, from a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation infinitely greater and worse than Death it self. When we look into <hi>Hell,</hi> and consider the Wrath that the Damned there lye under, O to behold them there restlesly rolling to and fro in Chains and Flames, to hear them exclaim against their own Folly and Madness, and to curse Themselves and their Associates as the Causes of their heavy and doleful Torments; how should we rejoice that though we have been guilty of many great and heinous Sins, and have Ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand times deserved <hi>Hell</hi> and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlasting Burnings, yet our good and gracious God hath freely par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don'd us our Debts, and freed us from the same merited Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>

               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Use. </seg>3</label> This also should ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite us to magnifie the Love of our Lord Jesus Christ towards us, who though he knew what the dreadful Wrath of God was, how sore and heavy it would lye upon his Soul, yet such was his infinite Compassion towards us, that he willingly submitted him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to be in our stead, took upon him our Nature, that he might take upon him our Guilt; and first made himself wretched, that he might be made accursed. He drank off the whole bitter Cup of his Father's Wrath at one bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Draught, received the whole sting of Death into his Body at once; falls and dies under the Revenges of Divine Justice, only that we might be delivered from the Wrath that we had deserved, but could not bear.
